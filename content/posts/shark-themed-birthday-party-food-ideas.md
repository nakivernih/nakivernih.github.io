The difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions: Some key distinctions.
Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times it’s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful way to get things done. When used correctly, they can help you solve problems and achieve your goals. There are many benefits to having ideas, including getting closer to your goals, making better decisions, andsaving time and energy. Here are three of the most common: 
1. Get closer to your goals: Ideas can help you achieve your desired outcome faster and more easily than if you had to worry about trying to do it alone. By having lots of different ideas on what could work, you’ll be able to come up with a variety of solutions that can help solve the problem at hand.

2. Make better decisions: Having lots of different optionsuddled under your pillow is a great way to make better choices faster than if you had to think through every option separately.
