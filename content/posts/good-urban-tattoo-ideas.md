Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for business?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new Idea or product. It can be something as simple as a new recipe for a baking soda soda recipe, or an innovative way to manufacture a product. This can be extremely beneficial to businesses, as it allows them to quickly and easily come up with new ideas and products that they can sell. However, there are a few key aspects to Invention that businesses should keep in mind if they want to successful pursue this type of endeavor. First, Invention requires creativity and risk-taking. Second, Invention often needs to be developed on the fly, and must be tailored specifically for the business – not just what someone else has already created. Finally, Inventions must meet certain criteria in order for them to be considered patentable – such as being novel and non-obvious.

Ideas: How can we use new ideas toOur lives?
There are so many new ideas out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
-Start with a problem. What do you need more of? More money? More love? Something in between? When you start thinking about things this way, you'll be more likely to come up with ideas for addressing your needs in new and innovative ways. 
-Think outside the box. What if there was a way to use something that's usually used for something else? For example, think about using recycled materials in architecture. You could create unique, sustainable structures with ease! 
-Consider your own needs first. What do you need more of in life than money or love? After all, those two things are obviously necessary for most people. But what do you really need in order to feel fulfilled and happy?

The best ways to be creative
There is no one answer for how to be creative. However, some ways to become more creative include: practicing brainstorming, keeping a journal, and taking on new challenges.
One way to become more creative is to practice brainstorming. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate new ideas. To brainstorm, you can start by asking yourself questions about a topic or problem you are trying to solve. Once you have generated some ideas, you can then evaluate them and choose the best solution.

Another way to become more creative is to keep a journal. A journal can help you track your thoughts and ideas over time. You can also use it to explore new topics and problems. By writing down your thoughts, you can better understand your own thought process and come up with new ideas more easily.
