Big Ideas are the seeds of new ideas and they can be anything from a simple change to something that has never been done before. Here are 8 examples of big ideas: 
1. Let people pay for their own health care. 
2. Get rid of student loan debt. 
3. Create a national energy policy that is environmentally friendly. 
4. Re-balance the U.S budget so that it spends less on defense and more on education, infrastructure, and green transportation projects. 
5. Do away with food stamps and welfare as we know them and create a system where individuals receive income based on results rather than need or dependency.

However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.
