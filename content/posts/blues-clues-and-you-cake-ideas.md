Make a DIY clock: Start with an old piece of furniture, and add custom features

Not only can you customize it with your own features, but you can also get creative and create a unique piece of art. Here are some ideas for how to make your own DIY clock:
1. Use an old piece of furniture as the base. This is the most common option, and it's affordable too. You can use any kind of wood or metal that you have lying around – even a old door handle will do. Place the clock on top of the furniture, and screw in any straps that come recommended.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.

Creative people are often thought of as those who have a great imagination and can come up with new ideas. However, creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas; creativity can also be used to create something that already exists. This is what many creative people do when they are trying to come up with a new design for their product or when they are creating a new idea for a project.
