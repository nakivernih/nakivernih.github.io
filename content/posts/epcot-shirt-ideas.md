How to declutter your home using easy and affordable methods
decluttering your home is a great way to improve your quality of life and make it more organized. There are a variety of easy, affordable declutter methods that can help you get rid of clutter and improve your home. Here are a few examples:
1. Use bins and boxes to store seasonal items. This will help you keep your home free from clutter during the offseason, when there is less demand for space.

2. Create racks or shelves to hold items that can be used multiple times or kept in rotation. This will help you keep your home clean and organized while you use it again next year.

3. Place empty boxes, cans, cups, or other small objects on the floor where they will not block traffic or create noise. This will help you declutter quickly and easily without having to think about it too much.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
