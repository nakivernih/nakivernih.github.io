The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.

conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.
