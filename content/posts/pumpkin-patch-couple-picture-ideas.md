Patent protection: What are the different types of patent protection?
Patent protection is a type of intellectual property that helps to protect ideas and other creative works. There are many different types of patent protection, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Here is a list of the most common types of patent protection:
1) Patent for invention: This type of patent protects the idea behind an invention, rather than the specific products or services that are produced as a result. This type of protection can be helpful for businesses who want to protect their new ideas from potential competitors, but it can also be expensive to obtain.

2) Patent for trade secret: This type of patent protects a confidential business information, such as a recipe or design. This protection can be helpful for businesses who want to keep their secrets safe, but it can also be difficult to enforce.

What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. You’ll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, you’re less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. You’ll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.
