One idea is to institute a universal basic income, which would give all citizens a fixed amount of money without any strings attached. Another idea is to legalize marijuana, which would help to reduce the amount of crime and underage drinking. Finally, another idea is to increase the number of hours worked per week, which would lead to more saved money and less need for job security.
