This can be done individually or in a group setting. When brainstorming, it is important to not judge or critique ideas, but simply to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a list of ideas, you can then start to narrow down and choose the best ones.

brainstorming: How do you start brainstorming?
brainstorming is a process by which creative ideas are generated. It can be used to come up with solutions to problems, new concepts or just thinking out loud. There are different ways you can start brainstorming and it really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for ideas for your next project then the best way to start is by talking to friends, family or others who have had the same experience. If you are looking for ideas for personal projects then there are many different ways to generate them. One way is by using online tools like Google Docs or Excel. Another way is by taking a walk around your neighbourhood and seeing what people are doing that might be inspiration for your own project. The bottom line is that regardless of what method you choose, always ensure that you are working in a productive manner and that you are making sure that your ideas get put into action.

The Process of Inventing
Invention ideas can come from many sources. Sometimes people get invention ideas from everyday life experiences, while others get their ideas from solving problems they encounter in their work. Many times, people get invention ideas from observing how other people use products or how machines operate. The key to generating invention ideas is to be observant and to look for problems that need solving.
Once you have an idea for an invention, the next step is to figure out how it will work. This involves doing some research and experimentation to develop a prototype of your invention. Once you have a working prototype, you can then test it to see if it works as intended. If it does, you can then start marketing your invention and selling it to consumers.
