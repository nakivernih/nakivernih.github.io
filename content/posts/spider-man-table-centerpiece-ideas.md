conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.

How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.
