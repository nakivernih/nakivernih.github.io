What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

The difference between creativity and inspiration: What are some of the benefits of having more creativity?
Creativity is a term often used to describe different aspects of one’s life. It can be used to describe things like coming up with new ideas, or coming up with solutions to problems. Inspiration, on the other hand, is a more specific word that refers to a feeling or emotion that one experiences when looking at something and thinking about how it could be improved.
There are several benefits of having more inspiration in one’s life. For example, inspiration can help you come up with new ideas and strategies for solving problems. It can also help you feel more motivated and inspired when working on projects. In addition, inspiration can help you become more creative in your own artwork and writing. Finally, inspiration can help you develop your overall business idea or concept.
