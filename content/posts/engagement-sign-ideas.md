Patent Applications: How do you file for an invention?
Patent applications are a common way to get your ideas out into the public domain. They can also be a way to protect your intellectual property and increase your chances of getting paid for your innovations. Here are some tips on how to file for an invention: 
- Make sure you have the proper paperwork in order to filing an application. This includes a patent application, published works, and any other supporting information. 
- Be prepared to answer many questions from researchers and patent applicants. It can be helpful to have an idea of what you're trying to create before you start filing. 
- File as soon as possible after the idea comes up in conversation or when you notice something that makes it interesting. You may not get the same response if you wait too long.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.
