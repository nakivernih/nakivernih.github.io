Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people: How does the subconscious contribute to creativity?
Creative people often have a higher level of awareness and are better equipped to see connections between ideas and the world around them. This can lead to new and more thought-provoking ways of looking at things, which in turn allows them to be more creative. However, it's not just the conscious mind that is responsible for creativity - the unconscious mind also plays a part. The unconscious mind is made up of hidden thoughts, feelings, and memories that we don't usually consider. It's where our creative potential lies - it's where we store all our ideas, inspiration, and dreams. Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people can help them become more aware of their own power and potential to be creative. By understanding how the subconscious helps us to be more creative, they can use their creativity to achieve their goals.

How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!
