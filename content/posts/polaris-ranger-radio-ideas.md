Product/Service sections: What problems do you think need to be solved in order to make a better product or service?
There are a number of things that need to be solved in order to make a better product or service. One area where new ideas could help is in the area of customer service. Many people feel that the service that they receive when purchasing a product is not up to par and this is especially true when it comes to online services. This problem needs to be addressed in order for people to feel confident with their purchase. Another issue that needs to be solved is with the way products are offered.
