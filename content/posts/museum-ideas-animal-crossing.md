Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make a cup of coffee or coming up with a new way to market your products.

Ideas are a necessary part of any life. Without ideas, there would be no point in living. Some people think that ideas are just things that people come up with and don't really have a use for, but that's not always true. Ideas can be anything from a new way to cook your favorite food, to the perfect way to improve your work. There is no one right way to come up with ideas, so it really depends on what you're interested in.
