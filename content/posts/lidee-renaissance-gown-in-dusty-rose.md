Conclusion:
A new way of looking at the world is about to hit the market and it has the potential to change the way we live, work, and think. called "Non-Physical Reality" or NPE, this new understanding of reality is based on the idea that everything in the world is actually energy. This means that everything has a power and can be used to achieve things. It's a radical idea but one that could have big impacts on our lives if accepted.

3.1 What are some potential steps we can take to get started on finding a solution to our problem?
The problem we are trying to solve can seem daunting and difficult, but with some creativity and effort, it is possible to find a solution. There are a number of steps that can be taken in order to get started on finding a solution, and these steps will vary depending on the problem at hand. Some possible steps include: 
1.starting with an idea – when there is no clear solution as to what the problem may be, it is often best to start by brainstorming potential solutions. This can involve thinking about what could go wrong or how something could be improved, and from this, you may be able to come up with ideas for fixing the issue. 
2.finding collaborators – once you have some ideas for fixes or solutions, it is important to find collaborators who are familiar with the subject matter or who might have other ideas that would work better.

The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?

Creative outliers: What are some people who do great work in their field but are not typically thought of as artists?
One example is Vincent van Gogh, who was famously known for his "The Starry Night" painting. Another example is Jeff Koons, who is considered one of the most influential art dealers in the world. Koons' work often features colorful and grotesque objects that are not typically found in traditional art.
