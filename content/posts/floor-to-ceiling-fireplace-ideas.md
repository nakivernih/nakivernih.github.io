Ideas for Art and Design: What are some possibilities?
Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.

Origins of innovation: How did people get inventive ideas?
Invention ideas come from a diversity of sources, from people who are just starting out, to those who have been working on something for years. But there are some key elements that are always in play when someone comes up with an innovative idea. These include the idea itself, and how it can be realized. For example, a person might come up with the idea of a new product or service, but may not have any clear ideas about how to make it happen. To get started, they need to have some conception of what they want their invention to do and how it could be used. From there, they can work on coming up with a way to make their idea a reality.
