Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!

The future of work is anything but clear. Some experts believe that the internet will eventually disappear and that people will must rely on traditional methods of working, such as jobs in factories or offices. Others think that artificial intelligence and other technologies will soon make it possible for people to work from home, receive health benefits, and even become self-employed. While there are many potential outcomes to what the future of work may hold, it is important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. What works for one person may not work for another.
