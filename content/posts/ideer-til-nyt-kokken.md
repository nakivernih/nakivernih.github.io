History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!

How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful.

The benefits of DIY projects: How do they help you?
Are you looking for ways to make your life easier? There are many DIY projects that can help you do just that. Whether you're looking to make a new kitchen appliance, refinish an old one, or just change up your decor, there are many possibilities. Here are four tips on how to start making your own DIY projects: 1. Decide what you want to achieve by doing the project. If you're trying to fix something broken, it might be easier to buy the parts and tools needed instead of building it yourself. When creating a project, think about what will save time and help you reach your goals. For example, if you're refinishing an old piece of furniture, think about which materials will take the least amount of time and effort to clean and remove. 2. research the subject matter before starting the project.
