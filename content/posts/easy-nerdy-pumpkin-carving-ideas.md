Types of creativity: What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that involves personal Vince Vaughn moments and doesn't stem from classical sources. While non-creative art often relies on pre-existing images or templates, creative artists often come up with their own ideas and concepts. This type of creativity can be seen in everything from graffiti to photography. There are many different types of creative art, but the most common ones include mural painting, sculpture, music composition, and fine arts.

How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

Patenting an idea: When does one have the right to patent an invention?
When does one have the right to patent an invention? There is no definitive answer, but many experts say that an inventor has the legal right to protect their ideas as soon as they come up with them. This typically happens after a person creates a new product or service that could be used in commerce and makes some sort of contribution to society.

Definition of invention:
Inventions are creative ideas that come about as a result of a person's efforts. They can be things like a new product or service, or just some new technology. Inventions can have a lot of different meanings, depending on the person who created it. For example, a clothing company might create a new style that is different from all the others out there. Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.
