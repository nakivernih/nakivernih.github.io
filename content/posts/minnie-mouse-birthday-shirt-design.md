Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that can be broken down into three main parts: Ideation, Execution, and Delivery. Ideation is the process of coming up with ideas or solutions to problems. Execution is the task of putting these ideas into action and making them a reality. Delivery is the final step in the creative process, which includes making sure that the ideas are implemented and realized properly.

I was born in 1984, and I'm now a Sophomore at Stanford University in California. My parents were both Scientists. My father is a Scientist and my mother is a Engineer. I always loved Science because it was the only thing that was constant in my life. When I was younger, I would watch molecule-by-molecule movies and take detailed notes on what everything looked like. This led to me wanting to become a Scientist myself one day.
