Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas, is an essential part of any skill set. It’s what allows people to create things that no one else could think of and make them their own. Different creativity techniques can be used in order to achieve different goals.
Some common creative art forms include painting, sculpture, poetry, music and advertising. Each has its own unique way of expression and can be used to communicate a message or tell a story. Some artists are even known for their completely original pieces that may not be found elsewhere.

The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.
