The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.
