The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

The Place of Brainstroming in Life:
across all walks of life, brainstroming is a common occurrence. It can be found in people of all ages and backgrounds, from business professionals to parents. Whether it's attending a meeting or working on a project, brainstroming is an essential part of any successful day. However, what makes brainstroming so special is that it doesn't always have to be negative. In fact, Brainstroming can often lead to creativity and new ideas. For example, if you're stuck on an assignment and don't know how to get started, Brainstroming might help you come up with a solution. And if you're feeling overwhelmed at work or school, there are plenty of ways to work through the challenges head-on without needing help from outside sources. So whether you're a brainstromer or not, there's no reason not to take advantage of this natural process!
