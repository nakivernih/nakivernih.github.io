Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:
1. Create a To-Do List: A to-do list can help keep things organized and on track. Not only does it make life easier, but keeping a to-do list can also help you stay inspired as you work.

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
