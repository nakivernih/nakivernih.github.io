What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
