Tips for working with clients
Creative Ideas: When working with clients, always have an idea of what you want to achieve. This will help you to better understand the client's needs and desires. Additionally, it can give you a starting point for your proposals and ideas. If you're not sure what the client wants, ask them! This will help to ensure that your proposal is tailored specifically to their needs and wishes. Finally, be sure to keep in mind that no one is perfect, so don't expect anything from your clients without first trying your best.
