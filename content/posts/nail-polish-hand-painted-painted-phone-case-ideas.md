Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.

Another obstacle that can impede innovation is a fear of change. This may be due to a reluctance to embrace new technologies or a fear that change will lead to disruptions in the business.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.
