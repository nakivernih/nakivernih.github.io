The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

The power of community: How can businesses connect with their customers?
As businesses become more reliant on the internet, they must find new ways to connect with their customers. Some ideas include using social media, forums, or phone banking to build relationships and get feedback. Other methods include visits to local stores or events. By doing this, businesses can learn what works and what doesn’t for them, and adapt their services to better meet the needs of their customers.

What are the options for ideas?
Ideas are a valuable asset for businesses and individuals. They can be used to generate new ideas, come up with new products or services, or come up with new ways of doing things. Unfortunately, not every idea is a good one. Sometimes ideas are just too crazy or too innovative for the marketplace to take on. There are two ways to overcome this obstacle: 1) Find a market for your idea and 2) Make sure your idea is something that the market wants.
