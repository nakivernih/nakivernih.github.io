What are big ideas? What are some of the most important things to remember when it comes to big ideas?
There are a few important things to remember when it comes to big ideas. The first is that ideas should be focused and specific. If they're not, they'll likely never see the light of day. Second, it's important to have a plan for execution. This will help ensure that your idea actually happens, and doesn't just languish in your head. Finally, you need some backing from others before you can start anything truly big. Without this support, it's more difficult to truly push an idea off the ground.

The future of work: what will be needed for a Robots Apocalypse?
Work is currently the foundation of society. It allows people to earn a living and provide for their families. However, as technology continues to advance, it is clear that work will need to change in order to accommodate the needs of an all-out robotic apocalypse. Some key ideas that could be implemented in order to make work more efficient and affordable include robotically joining factories as production lines, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in order to automate tasks, and implementing robots into service industries such as healthcare or manufacturing. With so much at stake for the future of work, it is important to consider what needs to be done in order to make this type of change a reality.
