The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.

Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?
