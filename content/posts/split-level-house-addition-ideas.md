Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.

The golden rule for getting ideas: You have to be passionate about it
Ideas are a lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we may as well be living in a cave. However, if you're not passionate about your ideas, you'll likely never get very far with them. So how do you get started? The key is to be passionate about your idea and to continue to develop it over time. If you can focus on what you're passionate about and keep pushing yourself, eventually your ideas will improve and you'll be on your way to becoming a great thinker.
