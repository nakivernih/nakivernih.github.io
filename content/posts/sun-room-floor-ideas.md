what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before. 
Creative art can be therapeutic and can help you express yourself in a way that you might not be able to with words. It can also be a form of relaxation and can help reduce stress. 

Whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to doodle, creative art is for everyone. So get out your paints, pencils, or whatever else you like to use, and start creating!

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

Invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has been a key feature of human history. From the development of tools and weapons to the invention of new transportation methods, innovation has always been a part of human culture. However, over time, innovation has become more complex and dynamic. Innovation can be described as the process by which new ideas, technologies, or business models are created. It encompasses everything from developing new products to creating new ways of doing business.
One example of this evolution is the development of technology. Technology has constantly changed over time and has helped increase efficiency in many industries. For example, airplane travel was originally difficult and expensive to achieve, but with the development of airplanes, people could now travel all over the world easily. The same can be said for computer programs and other technological developments. By changing how we use these technologies, we have increased their efficiencies and made them more available to everyone.
