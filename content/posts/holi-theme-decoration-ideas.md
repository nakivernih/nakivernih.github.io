This has led to a Barnett Formula where richer countries are being forced to invest more in infrastructure and cup tournaments, while poorer ones have less money available. This has created opportunities for nations such as Russia and Qatar to bid for the event, but also raised eyebrows across the world about who should be hosting it – and whether they can afford it.

2. The U21 World Cup is now one of the most important tournaments on global soccer calendar.
