The history of invention: from the ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers
Invention ideas have been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that they continue to be a part of our daily lives today. From ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers, some inventions have had a lasting impact on society and the world. Here are five examples:
1) The wheel was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used it to move goods around their cities.

2) The telescope was invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, which allowed him to see things that were previously impossible to see.

3) The telephone was invented by Samuel Morse in 1876, which allowed people to communicate with one another without having to speak directly.

4) The computer was invented by Charles Babbage in 1871, which allowed people to create new ways of doing calculations.
