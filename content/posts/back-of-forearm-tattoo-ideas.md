How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure. Have you ever tried something and it didn't work out? Don't be afraid to give up. You can always try again later if the first attempt doesn't work. 3) Have a plan. A plan is key in making sure that your creative project goes smoothly and that you don't run into any problems along the way. 4) Be willing to grow and learn.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.

Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas. Big ideas are solutions that are large enough to be accomplished, but small enough that they can be implemented. There are many ways to come up with big ideas, so it is important to find the one that works best for you. Some ways to find big ideas include: 
1) thinking out loud – When you have a lot of ideas racing through your head, it can be helpful to take a break and talk about some of them with someone else. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and avoid getting lost in your thoughts. 
2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.
