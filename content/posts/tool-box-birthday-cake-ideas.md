How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

Conclusion: What to do if You Start a Blog but Do Not Have Any Ideas
A lot of people start blogs, but they don't know what to do next. Here are some tips to help you get started: 
1) Choose a topic you're interested in. Once you've chosen a topic, research how to write about it effectively. You can find helpful articles and tutorials online or in books.
2) Start with a small audience. If your blog only has a handful of readers, you'll likely be able to start off by posting updates and tasks related to your topic rather than developing your content further. 
3) Take some time for planning and editing. Once you've created an initial post, make sure to spend time editing it and proofreading it for errors. This will help make sure that your blog is well-written and error-free before publishing it!
