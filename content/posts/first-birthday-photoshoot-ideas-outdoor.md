The Importance of Ideas: What makes them so important?
Ideas are what make up the foundation of any organization. They can be wrapped up in a few words, or they can be something larger that needs to be planned and executed in a complete way. Ideas need to be carefully considering before being implanted into an organization, as well as being developed for the long term. Without ideas, there would be no progress made in any business venture, regardless of its size or complexity.

The creative process: How does one go about coming up with an invention?
Invention ideas come to us in all forms- written, verbal, or graphical. Some people start with the idea of what they want to create and then work backwards from there. Others have a pure invention idea that is completely new and has no precedent within the industry. There is no right or wrong way to come up with an invention, as long as it's creative and futuristic. The process of coming up with an invention begins by brainstorming different ideas on paper or on a computer. Once you've collected a few good ideas, it's time to get them down on paper or in your head for further thought. Once you've created some rough sketches, it's time for refinement and development. The next step is testing- doing research on the subject matter you're consideringbefore submitting your product to market.
