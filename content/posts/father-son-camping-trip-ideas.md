Origins of Innovation: Why do people invest in innovation?
Innovation is a term that is used to describe a range of different activities and ideas that have the potential to make a difference in someone’s life. Some of the reasons why people might invest in innovation include wanting to change the world, feeling like they can do something better than anyone else, or simply needing a new idea to try out. There are many different types of innovation, and each has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. One of the most important things to remember when considering whether or not innovation is right for you is to ask yourself what you need it for. If you don’t think you need it, then chances are it won’t be an important part of your Innovation strategy.

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.
