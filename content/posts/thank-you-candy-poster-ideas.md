what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.

How creativity can help us: Creativity can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans.
Creativity has been said to be one of the most important skills a person can have. It can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans. While creativity is often seen as a positive attribute, not everyone is naturally creative. However, there are ways to improve creativity and become more inventive. Here are eight tips for becoming more creative: 
1. Be open to new ideas. The more open you are to new ideas, the more likely you are to come up with them. If you're resistant to change or don't like trying new things, it will be difficult for you to be creative.

2. Give yourself time and space to think creatively. When you're stuck on a problem or have an idea for something new, give yourself some time away from distractions so that your brain can work freely.
