Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

The scientific and technological revolutions: What did these change about the definition of invention?
Invention is a definition that has been in use for centuries. However, during the last two hundred years, there have been several technological revolutions that have redefine what it means to be an inventor. The first of these was the introduction of the machine gun in the late eighteenth century. This change in technology allowed armies to fight on a much larger scale and made war possible for the first time.
