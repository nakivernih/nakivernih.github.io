Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.

Patent Ideas: How do you get your invention patentized?
Patent ideas are a valuable tool for businesses. They can help you protect your invention, and make sure that your idea is protected by law. However, getting your invention patentized can be a challenge. There are a few ways to get your idea patented, and it depends on the specifics of your invention. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Do your research: When you come up with an idea, it's important to do your research. You need to know what kind of protection you want, how long it'll take to get it approved, and what other risks there may be associated with getting the patentized version of your idea out there. 

2. Get in touch with the right people: Once you've come up with an idea, it's important to get in touch with the right people.
