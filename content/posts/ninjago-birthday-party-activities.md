Patent Applications: How do you file for an invention?
Patent applications are a common way to get your ideas out into the public domain. They can also be a way to protect your intellectual property and increase your chances of getting paid for your innovations. Here are some tips on how to file for an invention: 
- Make sure you have the proper paperwork in order to filing an application. This includes a patent application, published works, and any other supporting information. 
- Be prepared to answer many questions from researchers and patent applicants. It can be helpful to have an idea of what you're trying to create before you start filing. 
- File as soon as possible after the idea comes up in conversation or when you notice something that makes it interesting. You may not get the same response if you wait too long.

The role of innovation in the economy: How do businesses use it?
Innovation is a key ingredient in the success of businesses. It allows businesses to continuously improve their products and services, which leads to increased profits and better customer service. However, innovation can also be a cost-effective way for businesses to increase their chances of success. For example, Google was founded on the idea that search engines could be improved so that people would find more information faster. By continually improving its search engine, Google became one of the most successful businesses in history. Likewise, Apple was once considered a startup company with little chance of success because its products were not innovative. But because it invested in research and development, Apple was able to create some of the most popular devices in history such as the iPhone and iPad. Innovation is essential to business success and can play a major role in helping companies reach new heights.
