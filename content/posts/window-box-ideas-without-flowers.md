The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
The challenges of invention are many and varied. Inventors must first come up with an idea that is both novel and useful. They then need to find a way to turn that idea into a reality, which often requires a great deal of trial and error. Even after an invention is completed, there are still challenges to be faced, such as marketing the invention and ensuring that it meets all safety and regulatory requirements.

Innovation: How can new ideas be brought to market and be successful?
New ideas are one of the most important things that a company can bring to market. Successful companies have been able to develop new ideas that go beyond the standard and bring in new customers and profits. Here are some tips on how to bring your new idea to market:
1. Be prepared for rejection
One of the biggest challenges for any new idea is being rejected by those who have been familiar with your product or service before. This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
It takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to bring your idea to market. However, if you keep at it, you will eventually reach your goals.

The impact of globalization on business: What will be the largest impacts from globalization in 2022?
When it comes to business, globalization is quickly on the rise. With more people living in cities and countries near by, businesses have to adapt or go out of business. In 2022, there are many big global changes that will have an impact on businesses and individuals. Here are some of the biggest potential impacts: 
1) The rise in electronic commerce will lead to increased demand for goods and services from all over the world. This increase in demand can be difficult to meet, as manufacturers must compress production times and find new ways to reach consumers. 
2) Rising labor costs will hike prices for goods and services, even for low-cost countries. This increase in costs can force companies to reduce their output or even close their doors altogether. 
3) A crackdown on tax evasion by multinational corporations could lead to increased taxes on these companies’ profits worldwide.
