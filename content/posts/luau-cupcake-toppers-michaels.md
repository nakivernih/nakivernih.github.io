The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions. In order to achieve success in any field, it is important to have a good understanding of creativity and its benefits. Here are three key points that can help you achieve success: 1. Creativity can help you solve problems. When you have an idea that is different than what others have tried before, it can be helpful to bring your own ideas to the table and see if they are able to work together. This allows for creative thinking and problem solving, which can lead to innovative ideas and products. 2. Creativity can help you build relationships with other people.

Examples of good and bad ideas.
There are many good and bad ideas out there, but which one should you choose to pursue? It's important to take the time to think about what will work best for your business and your goals. Here are some examples of good and bad ideas: 
-A single product: This can be a great idea if you have a small budget or if you want to focus on one specific market. However, it can be difficult to make money off of a single product.

- Franchises: Franchises are a great way to bring in new customers and make money off of them. However, they can also be risky because you may not be able to keep up with the same customer base.

- Offering services: Offering services can be a great way to attract new customers and make money off of them.
