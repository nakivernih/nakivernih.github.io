The power of brainstorming: What are some good tips for brainstorming?
brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas. It can be used for anything from developing new products to finding a new business idea. Here are five tips for brainstorming: 1) Be specific about what you want to come up with. This will help you focus on the best ideas and avoid getting stuck in your routine. 2) Make sure you have a clear goal or target audience in mind before starting. This will help you find potential solutions that are relevant to your target market. 3) Work together with other people. This will give you the opportunity to exchange ideas and get feedback. 4) Avoid overthinking things. Just because something looks like it could be a good idea doesn’t mean it is! 5) Be patient and allow yourself time to think things through thoroughly.
