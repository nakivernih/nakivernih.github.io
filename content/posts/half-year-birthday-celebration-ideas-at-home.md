Examples of creative thinking in business
Creativity is a critical component of business. In fact, creativity is seen as one of the most important skills for businesses to possess. There are a number of ways businesses can use creativity in their operations and this column will explore an example from a logistics company. 
A logistics company is responsible for moving goods around the country. They need to come up with ideas for avoiding congestion and getting the products to their customers on time. One way they do this is by coming up with new ways to package products and get them to customers faster.

One idea they came up with was using 3D printing technology to create custom boxes for each product. This would allow them to print boxes that would be specific to the product and meet the customer's needs exactly.
