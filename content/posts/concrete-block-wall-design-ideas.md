What is big ideas?
Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. Big ideas can be so big that they become irrelevant or unimportant, and can lead to nothing more than indifference or a lack of interest in what a person has to say. But there are certain things that make for great ideas, and those things vary depending on the person. Some great examples of big ideas are:1) A new way of looking at life – This could be anything from simplifying complex concepts to coming up with a new perspective on old injustices.2) A new way of doing business – This could involve starting a company, working on a project with others, or making a change in the way people live.3) A new way of thinking about the world – This could be anything from exploring different perspectives to proposing a new perspective on an existing doctrine.
