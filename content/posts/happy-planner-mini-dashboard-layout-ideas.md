Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
