state the purpose of the blog article
1. A blog is a platform where people can share their ideas and views on various topics. It is a way of expressing oneself and connecting with like-minded people.
2. A good blog article should have a purpose, whether it is to inform, entertain or inspire the reader. Without a purpose, the article will be aimless and directionless.

3. The best way to choose a purpose for your article is to consider what you want the reader to take away from it. What do you want them to think or feel after reading it? Once you have decided on the purpose of your article, everything else will fall into place.

5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends?
