The Different Types of Brainstroming:
As we all know, brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected thoughts or ideas. Brainstroming can be negative or helpful, and it can be associated with brainstorming sessions or creative thinking. There are three main types of brainstroming: cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal. 
Cognitivebrainstroming is when someone has a suddenZ wave-like experience in their mind that includes new and innovative thought. These thoughts may be related to something that the person has been working on for months or years but never considered before. Emotionalbrainstroming is when someone experiences intense emotions such as joy, sadness, worry, or anger. It can be overwhelming to try and contain these feelings and they will often take over the person's mind completely.
