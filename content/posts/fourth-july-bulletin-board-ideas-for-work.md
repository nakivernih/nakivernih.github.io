The power of creativity: What does it mean for business?
Creativity is key to businesses. Without creativity, businesses couldn't exist. However, what does it mean for business? 
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. This can be done through brainstorming, creative thinking, or simply coming up with different options and concepts. 

However, creativity also has to be used wisely. Too much creativity can lead to a lack of focus and productivity in a business. And too little creativity can also lead to boredom or stagnation. 

So while creativity is key to businesses, it's also important that businesses use it in a responsible manner. Otherwise, they could get left behind in the competitive race for innovation.

Make a DIY clock: Start with an old piece of furniture, and add custom features
If you're looking for an easy and cost-effective way to keep time in your home, learning how to make a DIY clock is a great option. Not only can you customize it with your own features, but you can also get creative and create a unique piece of art. Here are some ideas for how to make your own DIY clock:
1. Use an old piece of furniture as the base. This is the most common option, and it's affordable too. You can use any kind of wood or metal that you have lying around – even a old door handle will do. Place the clock on top of the furniture, and screw in any straps that come recommended.
