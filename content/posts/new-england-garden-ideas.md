What is brainstroming and why is it important?
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the phenomenon of increased focus and productivity during periods of intense thought or concentration. Brainstroming is often seen as a benefit to people who are able to keep their minds focused on one task for more than a short period of time. Some believe that brainstroming can be used to improve problem solving, creativity, and decision making. However, there are several caveats to note when it comes to brainstroming. First, brainstroming can be difficult to maintain for any length of time; second, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving maximal effectiveness; and third, individuals respond differently to different types of brainstroming interventions.
