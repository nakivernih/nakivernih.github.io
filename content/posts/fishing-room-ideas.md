Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency. 

But there are other factors as well, such as the need for new ideas or approaches when it comes to solving problems or meeting needs. When these come together, they can result in radical change in an industry or society.

For example, Google was founded on the idea of bringing search results from different sources together so people could find what they were looking for quickly and easily. This led them to develop a variety of search engines that continues to be a mainstay on the internet today.

The Problem: How do we create meaningful ideas?
In order to create meaningful ideas, we need a strong understanding of what those ideas mean and how to put those ideas into practice. Unfortunately, most people lack these foundational skills. In order to get started, here are some basic tips: 
1. Think about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you determine how your idea can be used and adapted. 
2. Brainstorm with others for feedback andIdea generation challenges can be fun, but also helpful in getting feedback on whether or not your idea is conceptually good or bad. 
3. Come up with a working title for your idea before you even start thinking about it. This will give you an idea of what the word “idea” means and make sure that everyone who hears your idea understands it at its purest form (i.e., without any additional context).
