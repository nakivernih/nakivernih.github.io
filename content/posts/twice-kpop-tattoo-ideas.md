The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.

The word "innovation" is often used to describe how different new products or services are brought to market, but it has also been defined as the process of making something new from scratch. In business, innovation can mean different things to different people, and it can often be tougher than simply coming up with a new idea. Sometimes, companies have to go beyond the basics of product design and development in order to come up with innovative solutions.
