Section 1: Defining "Diy".
Diy, or "Do It Yourself" is a popular term that refers to the process of completing a task without the help of an outside professional. Diy projects can range from simple tasks like painting a room to more complex endeavors like building a deck. No matter what the project is, there are several key things to keep in mind when embarking on a Diy journey.
The first thing to consider is whether or not you have the time and patience to complete the project. Diy projects often take longer than expected and can be frustrating if you're not prepared for setbacks. It's important to set realistic expectations and give yourself plenty of time to finish the project.

Another thing to keep in mind is your skill level. Not all Diy projects are created equal. Some require more skills and knowledge than others.

The impact of technology on society: How will the impact of technology change society?
The impact of technology on society has been debated for years, but no definitive answer exists. In 2022, a group of researchers from Northeastern University released a report which suggests that technology will have a major impact on society. The report reflects on the future of technology and how it will affect different aspects of our lives, including work, education, and family life. 
One potential outcome is that more people will be employed through digital means. This could lead to an increase in income and wealth for those who can afford it, as well as fewer jobs available for those who cannot. It is also possible that this trend will lead to an increase in stress levels and tension within families. This could cause problems such as decreased productivity at work or increased absenteeism. 

Another potential outcome is that society may become more democratic.
