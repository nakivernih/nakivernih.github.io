How to Use Innovation to Drive Results
Innovations can help businesses achieve success. Here are four ways to leverage innovation to drive results:
1. Use innovation to improve productivity and efficiency. When products are redesigned or new processes are created, employees can be more efficient in their work. This can lead to reduced costs and increased profits.
2. Use innovation to create new markets. When businesses adopt innovative products or services, they may find new customers who would not have otherwise been reached. This can lead to increased sales and a larger profit margin.
3. Use innovation to change the way people live and work. Innovative ideas can help businesses change the way people live for the better, including by increasing efficiency and productivity. This could lead to increased customer loyalty and a higher return on investment (ROI).

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
