How does innovation help businesses succeed?
Businesses that are able to innovate and embrace change are able to grow their businesses faster and achieve success. Innovation can be done in a number of ways, but some of the most common methods include:
1. Bringing in new ideas – whether it’s from outside of the company or from within itself. This can help businesses see new possibilities and come up with innovative ways to improve their products or services.

2. Applying cutting-edge technology – again, whether it’s from outside of the company or from within themselves. With technology becoming more and more complex every day, innovation is key in being able to keep up with the changing trends.

3. Updating old methods – again, this could come from outside of the company or inside themselves if they’re using outdated processes or tools.

Origins of Invention: What inspired people to invent?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before.
