Causes and effects of innovation
Innovation is a key term in business. It can refer to any form of change that produces new products or services. But itâ€™s particularly important when it comes to technology, which has the ability to quickly and easily change the way people live and work.
There are a number of causes and effects of innovation, but one of the most important is how it affects companies. Innovation can create new customer relationships, improve product quality, or reduce costs. In addition, innovation can help companies attract and retain talent, which can make them better able to compete in the global market.

But while innovation is an important factor in business success, there are also some key risks associated with it. For example, some companies may experience high levels of competition from rivals who are motivated by identical or even greater innovations.
