The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

One thing that is different about the new ideas is that they often focus on solving problems instead of creating them. This makes them better at solving problems that have already been solved before, rather than creating new ones from scratch. 

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.
