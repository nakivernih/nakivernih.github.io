There is no one answer to the question of how we think. Our thoughts and ideas come from what we are familiar with, what we have learned in our past, and what we are reading or watching. Brainstroming is a process that allows us to process all of this information and come up with new ideas. It helps us to problem solve, plan, and make decisions.

5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends? There are a few ways to get feedback, but the most effective way is through an external review and recommendation. External reviews can help assess whether your idea is worth pursuing and, if so, whether there are any potential roadblocks that need to be addressed.
