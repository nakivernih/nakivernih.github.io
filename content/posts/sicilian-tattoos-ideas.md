2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

The challenges of innovation and its impact on business.
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of business. It allows firms to create new products and services that can be sold and generate new revenue. However, innovation can be challenging and has a strong impact on businesses. There are several challenges that companies face when trying to adopt innovative practices: 1) Lack of understanding of how innovation works – Many businesses are not sure what it takes to implement an innovation strategy and how it affects their business. 2) Implementation failures – When taking steps to adopt innovative practices, many firms end up implementing them incorrectly or without enough detail. This can lead to failed efforts, wasted resources and expensive lawsuits. 3) The negative effect of innovations – Some innovations have a significant positive impact on businesses such as increased efficiency or lowered costs. However, some innovations have a harmful impact, such as creating dependence on foreign manufacturers or exacerbating social disparities.
