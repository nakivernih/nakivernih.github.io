Conclusion: Invention ideas are a great way to get your idea out there and see what people think of it.
As a business owner, inventor, or just someone who loves to see their ideas come to life, it can be really exciting to see what other people think of your invention. It can also help get your idea out there and see how people are reacting to it. So many times, the less you know about your invention before you make it public, the more risky it is to try and market it yourself. But with the right invention ideas, you can take advantage of all the publicity that comes with them and make sure your idea is seen by as many people as possible.

Inspiration from nature:
Creative ideas come from all around nature. Sometimes they are simple, like a flower that can be picked up with your hands, or an animal that is easy to look at but hard to understand. Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.
