The golden rule for getting ideas: You have to be passionate about it
Ideas are a lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we may as well be living in a cave. However, if you're not passionate about your ideas, you'll likely never get very far with them. So how do you get started? The key is to be passionate about your idea and to continue to develop it over time. If you can focus on what you're passionate about and keep pushing yourself, eventually your ideas will improve and you'll be on your way to becoming a great thinker.
