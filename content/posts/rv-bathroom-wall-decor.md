The 4 Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are what make our world go round. They can help us achieve our goals, change the course of history, or even save the lives of others. But what makes an idea unique? What make them different from other ideas?
There are four types of ideas: big ideas, innovative ideas, refreshed and fresh ideas, and breakthrough ideas.

Big Ideas: A big idea is something that is very new and different. It can be a way to solve a problem that people have been trying to figure out for years or it can be a solution to an old problem. A big idea can be anything from a new product to a new way of looking at life.

Innovation Ideas: An innovation idea is an idea that is new and different but still based on older principles or methods. Innovation ideas can range from simple solutions to complex problems.

What are some common ways to generate ideas?
Ideas can come from a variety of places, including the mind, the heart, or the spirit. They might be sparked by something you see around you or hear in conversation, or they might be made up on your own. But whatever their source, ideas are a powerful thing and can help you think of ways to improve your life or solve a problem. Here are four tips on how to generate more ideas: 
1. Take some time for yourself – especially if you find that you don’t typically have time for creative thinking.

This could be anything from reading an interesting book to taking a walk outside.
