The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?
