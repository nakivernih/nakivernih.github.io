The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.

What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.
