Types of creativity: Abstract, Functional, Symbolic.
Creative arts are any art that is based on the creative process. These artists use their creativity to create something new and original. Creative arts can be found in all genres, but some are more popular than others. There are several different types of creative arts, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Functional art is often seen as the most creative type of creative art. It is based on simply completing a task or completing a goal. Functional artists are usually able to see the world in a specific way and they don’t need much inspiration to create their work. This type of artist often relies on intuition and common sense rather than studying or learning from others.

 Symbolic art is often seen as the second most creative type of artistic creation. This type of artist uses symbols to represent ideas or concepts that they want to communicate through their artwork.

The benefits of creative ideas.
Creative ideas can have a variety of benefits – from helping people find solutions to problems to boosting creativity. Here are four examples:
1. Creative ideas can help people solve problems. For example, a creative idea could be coming up with a new way to store food, such as using an airtight container or freezing food in order to make it last longer.

2. Creative ideas can also help people feel more Productive. When someone has a great idea for a product, they tend to be more inspired and motivated to produce the product themselves. This is especially true if the product is new and innovative – something that almost all products have at some point in their development cycle!

3. Finally, creative ideas can boost creativity overall.
