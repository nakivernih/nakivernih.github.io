What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.

Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. For businesses, invention can mean turning a concept into a reality.

Some inventions are so important that they are not only unique but also valuable to the company. These are called patentable inventions.

Ideas for stories or poetry: What are some creative ideas for stories or poems?
Creative ideas for stories or poems can be many things. They could be about a young person who is struggling, a loved one who has passed away, or an event that happened in someone's life that they are still reflections of.
