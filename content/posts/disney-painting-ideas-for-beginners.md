Creative art can be both therapeutic and functional. Therapeutic in that it can help to clear away any emotional or material debris that has built up in the individual, and functional as it can help people to express themselves in a new and unique way.

2. It can provide an escape from the mundane tasks that require daily routine, and also give people an opportunity to reflect on their feelings and thoughts. 
3. It can provideah opportunity for self-expression that is often overshadowed by more pressing concerns. 
4. It can stimulate thought processes, which can lead to better problem solving skills.

Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new concept for a business to coming up with a new design for a shirt. There are many creative ideas out there, but it can be hard to come up with the right one. Here are some tips to help you come up with the best ideas:
