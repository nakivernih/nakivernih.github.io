The benefits of creativity
Creativity has been linked with improved mental health, better educational outcomes and even enhanced workplace performance.
A recent study found that people who engage in creative activities are more likely to report higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction.

 creativity can also lead to better educational outcomes. A study of 3,000 primary school children in the UK found that those who took part in creative activities had higher grades than those who didn’t.

And it’s not just students who benefit from being more creative – employees do too. A study of 1,500 workers found that those who had high levels of creativity were more engaged with their work and had lower levels of absenteeism.
