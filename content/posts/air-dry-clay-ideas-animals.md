What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are some tips on how to find inspiration: 
-Look at what people have already done. This includes looking at art, design, and architecture. Try to see how they have created things that you like and then apply those ideas to your project. 
-Try different methods of creating something new. Use pens, pencils, paper, paints, or clay to create new things. Not everything needs to be composed in words. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective to start fresh and get inspired.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.
