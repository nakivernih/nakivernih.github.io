What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work. They can be something as small as a new product or service or as large as a new way of looking at the world. There are endless possibilities when it comes to big ideas, and there is no one right way to come up with them. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to let your brain explore new possibilities. When you’re starting out, it might be helpful to focus on just a few big ideas and see how they play out in your head. This will give you a good foundation for what else you might want to think about. 
2. Be creative.

How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!

It seems that no matter what enterprise you start, the next step is to come up with new ideas. Patenting your idea or coming up with a new way to do something can seem like an insurmountable task, but it's actually not as hard as it seems. In fact, many inventive minds are already working on new ideas and patenting them before they even have a chance to see the light of day.
