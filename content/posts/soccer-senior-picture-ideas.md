Ideation: How do you come up with new ideas for DIY projects?
Ideation is a process of coming up with new ideas for DIY projects. The key to success in ideation is taking your time and brainstorming multiple options. When you have a good idea, it's important to follow through with it. Here are a few tips on how to come up with new ideas:
1. Take your time – One of the best ways to come up with new ideas for DIY projects is to take your time. Don't go too fast or too slow; just be patient and allow yourself plenty of time to think about everything you've been thinking about lately.

2. Be open to variety – Some people prefer one style of project over another, while others may be more interested in multiple styles or colors together. Just because something appears simple on the outside doesn't mean it has to be that way on the inside!

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.

How creativity manifests in different people: Inventors are the most creative, while artists are more creative when they have a personal connection to their work
Creativity is not only evident in inventors, but also in artists. When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it. This has been shown by many studies that show creativity flourishes when people have close relationships with others. For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. 
However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.
