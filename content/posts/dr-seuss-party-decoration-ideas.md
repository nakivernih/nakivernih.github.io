Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.

How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.
