Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

Filming: How do you film your creative ideas?
Filming Creative Ideas can be a pretty enlightening experience, if done correctly. Not only do you get to see your ideas in action, but you also get to learn how to capture and film creative moments that will help you grow as a filmmaker. Here are four tips to filming creative ideas: 1. Do your research: before you start shooting, it‚Äôs important to do your research on what type of footage is going to work best for your story. What does the audience want? What are the challenges of capturing that vision successfully? These questions will help determine the filming techniques that work best for your project. 2. Get creative: not all creativity is created equal. Sometimes, filming creative ideas can be more about experimenting than taking risks.
