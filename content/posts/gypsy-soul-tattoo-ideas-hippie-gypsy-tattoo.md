Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from other types of change?
Innovation is a new way of doing things, or a change in the way things are done. Innovation can apply to any type of business, but it's most common in the technology and business sectors.
Different types of innovation can have different effects on businesses. For example, change in product design can lead to increased sales; change in distribution methods can lead to new customer base; and change in customer service systems can create new opportunities for growth.

There are a number of factors that go into defining innovation, including the specific industry or sector where it's being applied, the goals for the innovation, and how well it's executed. There are also five main characteristics that define innovation: risk-taking, creative thinking, rapid response time, team collaboration, and systemic impact.
