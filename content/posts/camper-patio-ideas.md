The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

The challenges of innovation: risk taking, competition, and change.
The challenges of innovation risk taking, competition, and change are three of the most important factors that affect the success of any business. Innovation can be risky, as it often means changing or adapting products or services in order to stay ahead of the competition.
