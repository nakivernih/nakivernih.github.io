What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

Why do people often have big ideas?
There is no one answer to this question, as people come up with big ideas for different reasons. Some people may have big ideas because they are passionate about something, or they think that their idea could make a significant impact. Other people may have big ideas because they feel like they have a great idea, but they need to turn it into a reality. In either case, having a big idea is important because it can help you focus and take on new challenges.
