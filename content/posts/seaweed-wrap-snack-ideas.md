Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
While it may be a cliché to say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box, Crandall's definition actually provides a more accurate definition for what makes creative individuals successful. By understanding how creativity works, businesses can better define their own goals and strategies for becoming more creative.
