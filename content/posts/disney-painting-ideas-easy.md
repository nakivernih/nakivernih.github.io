The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.
