Definition: Innovation: the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing.
Innovation is the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing. It can refer to various aspects of technology, business, and creativity. Innovation often occurs when a company or individual discovers a new way to do something that earlier versions were unable to do. Additionally, innovation can come from the invention of a new product or idea. However, it is also possible for innovation to come from the development of a technology that was never before used in the industry. In both cases, innovation is a key factor in creating value for customers and shareholders alike.

What is innovation and why is it so important?
The term “innovation” has been around for a long time, but its meaning has changed over time. In the old days, innovation referred to new technology or products. But in the days of digital age, innovation also refers to how we can use technology to improve our lives and businesses.
Innovation is key because it allows companies and individuals to perpetually alter their way of doing things and produce new ideas that can make a difference. It enables us to constantly learn and upgrade our methods so that we are better able to meet the challenges of the world. This is what makes innovation so important – it helps us keep up with the latest trends and developments.
