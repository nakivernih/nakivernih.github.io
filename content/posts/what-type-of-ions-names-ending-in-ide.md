Invention is a process that begins with the idea and ends with the product. It can be difficult to define what an invention is, but it is clear that it is a unique way of doing something. Inventions can come from any field of science and engineering, but they are most often associated with technology. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some inventions are more successful than others, but all have the potential to make a difference in our world.

What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there. This technology could be used for training new employees or salespeople, or even for entertainment purposes.

3. Another trend we can expect to see in 2022 is the growth of self-driving cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and efficiency features.

The Challenges of Big Ideas: What can be done to overcome them?
The challenge of big ideas is that they can be revolutionary, but also risky and time-consuming to achieve. Some things that can help overcome this challenge include developing a process for vetting and approval of ideas, as well as having a clear goal for the idea, both during its early stages and once it has been developed. Additionally, having a team of experts who can help with the development and implementation of an idea can make it easier to get the message out there and grow awareness around it.
