Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.
