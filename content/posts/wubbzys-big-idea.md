What are some ideas?
Great ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with new ones. Here are some tips to get you started: 
1. Look for inspiration from your favorite movies and stories. While it can be difficult to come up with original ideas on your own, watching familiar films or stories can help you develop a feel for what might work well in the world of TMNT. 
2. Be open to new possibilities. Don’t be afraid to try something different or explore what might be out of your comfort zone. This will give you a wealth of ideas to consider when crafting new TMNT concepts and storylines. 
3. Take your time.

Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one common goal: to help change the world.
