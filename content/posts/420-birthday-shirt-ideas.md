Invention Displays: How can you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of protecting your invention from others who may want to make use of it. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application. Patent applications can take many months to complete, so it’s important to be prepared for the wait. There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original. If you have any trouble filing a patent application or if it takes longer than expected, don’t worry – there are plenty of resources available to help you out.

What are some ideas?
There are many ideas when it comes to improving your health and well-being. Here are a few to get you started: 
1. Try a new diet or exercise routine. This can help improve your overall health by reducing your risk of disease, improving your energy levels, and reducing the likelihood of developing chronic conditions like obesity or heart disease. 
2. Get more sleep. Make sure you get at least 7 hours of sleep per night, preferably 8 hours or more. This will help improve your mental wellbeing, reduce stress levels, and promote better cognitive function. 
3. Get enough exercise. Losing weight is important for overall health, but being active also helps to prevent chronic diseases like obesity and heart disease from becoming established.

Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve efficiency, lower costs, create new products and services, or to solve problems that have been unsolved. Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.
There are several definitions of innovation that are used by different groups and individuals. One definition is "the process by which new ideas, products or services are created." This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.
