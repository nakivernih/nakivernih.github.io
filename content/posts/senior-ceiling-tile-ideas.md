Definition of creativity: What makes creativity possible?
Creativity, according to Webster’s Dictionary, is a “ state of being in which the mind is engaged in problem-solving and comes up with new ideas. It is often characterized as a process of creative thinking and creative creation.” In other words, creativity refers to an act or ability that creates new ideas or solutions to old problems. Creative artists are those who are able to express their creative thoughts and feelings through their art.
There are many different definitions of creativity, but one thing they all have in common is that they center around some sort of problem-solving ability. Whether it be coming up with new ideas for products or services, or coming up with ways to solve old problems, creativity is always a key ingredient in any successful business or artistic endeavors. So what makes creativity possible? And how can we become more like creatives?
