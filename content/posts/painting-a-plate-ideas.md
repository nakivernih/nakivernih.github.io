2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.

New thought processes for creativity
Creativity is a key word in today’s society. It seems like everyone has their own ideas and no one really knows where to start. Some people believe that creativity starts with theinnovation of your mind, while others believe that you have to have a lot of originality in order to be creative.
