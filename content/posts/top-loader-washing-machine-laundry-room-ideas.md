Many people believe that creative art is more about expression and emotion, than it is about the final product.

1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.
