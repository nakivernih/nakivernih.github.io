properties of innovation:
Innovation is a process of change that occurs when a new idea, product or service becomes more popular than the existing ones. Innovation can be seen as an exciting opportunity for businesses to create new products and services that improve their customers’ lives. The key to success in innovation is to have a strong vision and plan for the innovation, which can be difficult if the business does not have enough resources or if it does not have the rightpeople on board.
Innovation is often associated with technological progress, but it can also take place in other industries such as architecture and engineering. In architecture, innovation can take place in the design of buildings and infrastructure, as well as in the development of new technologies and marketing strategies.

Definition: Creative art is any art that is not traditional or common.
Creative art is not usually associated with traditional or common art styles. Instead, creative artists often use their own unique styles that are not typically found in other genres of art. This can be seen in many different forms, such as moderniste, cubist, and post-impressionist painting.

Invention and Technology
Invention and technology have brought many benefits over the years, including making life easier and improving our quality of life. However, sometimes these advancements can be dangerous, leading to new ways of harming people or other animals. For example, scientists have come up with a novel way to reuse metal objects by using a heat treatment process to make them incredibly strong and durable. This process can result in objects that are more resistant to breakage and are also more resistant to being used in dangerous situations.
