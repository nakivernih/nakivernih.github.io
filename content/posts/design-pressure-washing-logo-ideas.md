Conclusion: What are some lessons we can learn from history about Invention?
Invention is one of the most important aspects of human history. It has allowed us to make significant progress in many fields, including medicine, engineering, and transportation. However, there are also some lessons we can learn from history about Invention. For example, it is important to remember that Invention is a gradual process. The first step in any invention is to come up with an idea. Once you have a good idea, it is next important to find someone who can help you carry out your idea.

If it fails miserably, then you may have wasted your time and energy trying to create something that doesn't work.
