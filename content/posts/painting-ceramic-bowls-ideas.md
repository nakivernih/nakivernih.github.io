Definitions of creativity: What do they mean to us?
Creativity is a subjective term that can be defined in many ways. For some, creativity means being able to come up with new and innovative ideas. For others, creativity may mean taking risks and trying new things. However, the definition of creativity does not end there. There are many different concepts surrounding creativity which can help us understand its meaning for ourselves.
One key concept around creativity is "the creative process." This refers to the way in which people approach their work, including how they come up with new ideas and how they create solutions to problems. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: inspiration, ideation, and production. Inspiration comes from something that someone sees or hears, while ideation is when an idea is created without any prior thought or planning. Once an idea has been Ideated, it needs to be produced to make it a reality.

The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.

Brainstroming is a technique used by mentalists to help them discover the hidden thoughts and confessions of the people they are questioning. Brainstroming can be done by using questionnaires, interviews, or even conversation with the person in question. The goal of brainstroming is to gain a better understanding of their thoughts and feelings, which can then be used to help secure their confessions.

The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.
