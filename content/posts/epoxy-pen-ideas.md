Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of brainstorming, a type of thinking process where ideas are generated quickly and without any pre-determined order. Brainstroming can be helpful in finding new ideas or solutions to problems, and it can also be a great way to get feedback from others about your thoughts. Some people find Brainstroming to be relaxing and calming, while others find it difficult to focus on anything for very long.
