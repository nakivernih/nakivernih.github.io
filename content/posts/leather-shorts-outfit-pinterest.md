Why do you think your ideas are interesting?

1. Make sure your ideas are well-conceptualized and engaging. This means having a clear idea of what you want your product or service to do, and making sure it is interesting enough for people to want to try it.

2. Be clear about what your target audience is. If your idea is for a new product, make sure you know who your target market is, and how you plan on reaching them. This will help you focus on the right things when developing your pitch.

Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.
