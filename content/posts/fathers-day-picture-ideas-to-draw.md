Creativity and art: What are the benefits?
Creativity and art are two of the most important aspects of life. Whether it is working on a painting or writing a story, creativity is needed to create something new. However, there are some disadvantages to having great creativity. First, often times creativity can be difficult to control. Second, with great creativity comes a lot of risk. For example, if you don't have a good eye for color or if you make mistakes while painting, your work might not look as good as it could. But overall, the benefits of creativity far outweigh any negatives. So whether you're looking for an outlet to express yourself or just want to have fun, creative art is worth exploring!

Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.
