The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that makes someone happy. Whether it’s a new hobby, a new way of looking at the world, or just something to get them thinking, creativity is a must in any creative person’s life. Here are some fun creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take on a new challenge: When you feel like you can’t seem to do anything right, take on a new challenge and see if you can do it better than anyone else. This could be as simple as painting or sculpting an expression out of marble, or coming up with your own unique idea for an art project. 
2. Get organized: When you feel lost in your thoughts or don’t know where to start, getting organized will help you find your way back home.
