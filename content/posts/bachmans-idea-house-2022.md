Origins of Invention: How did people come up with ideas for new products and services?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that has not been tried before. It can be an idea for a new toy, a new way to make your product or service more marketable, or even a new way to do your business. Inventions are often based on something that someone else has already done, which allows people to start from scratch and come up with ideas that could be successful.
