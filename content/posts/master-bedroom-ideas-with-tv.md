Creative process: What are the steps?
Creative processes vary depending on the individual, but typically there are three main steps. The first step is to come up with an idea or idea for a project. This can be done through any creative medium such as writing, drawing, painting, etc. Once the idea has been created it is important to test it out and see how it sounds or looks. The second step is to create a rough plan or outline of the project. This will help to better understand what needs to be done and when. The third step is to begin working on the project. This can involve starting with small tasks and working your way up until you have a completed product.

How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the process or art of creating something new, whether it is a physical object, a piece of software, or a process. It is an important part of human history and has played a significant role in our development as a species.
Invention is not just about coming up with something new; it is also about improving upon existing ideas and technologies. This can be seen in the way that many inventions are built upon the work of previous inventors. For example, the Wright brothers were able to build upon the work of earlier aviation pioneers to create the first successful airplane.

Invention is also about solving problems. Inventors are often motivated by a desire to solve a particular problem that they have encountered in their own lives. This was the case with Benjamin Franklin, who invented the lightning rod after being struck by lightning himself.
