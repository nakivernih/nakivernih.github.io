Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
Creativity is one of the most important aspects of our lives. It is what allows us to express ourselves, to come up with new ideas, and to problem solve. Without creativity, we would be stuck in the same routines day after day.
Creativity is not just for artists or musicians. Everyone has the ability to be creative in their own way. It is important to encourage creativity in children from a young age as it can help them in both their personal and professional lives.

There are many benefits to being creative, including reducing stress, improving mental well-being, and increasing cognitive skills. Creativity can also lead to happiness and a sense of fulfilment.

We all have the potential to be creative. It is something that we should cherish and nurture throughout our lives.

Definitions of creativity: What do they mean to us?
Creativity is a subjective term that can be defined in many ways. For some, creativity means being able to come up with new and innovative ideas. For others, creativity may mean taking risks and trying new things. However, the definition of creativity does not end there. There are many different concepts surrounding creativity which can help us understand its meaning for ourselves.
One key concept around creativity is "the creative process." This refers to the way in which people approach their work, including how they come up with new ideas and how they create solutions to problems. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: inspiration, ideation, and production. Inspiration comes from something that someone sees or hears, while ideation is when an idea is created without any prior thought or planning. Once an idea has been Ideated, it needs to be produced to make it a reality.

What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.

Thesis: Why do we need to think about ideas more?
Ideas are important, but they're not the only thing we need to worry about when it comes to our mental health. Our mental health is also affected by how well we think. We need to be more mindful of how we think and how our thoughts affect our emotions and behavior.
