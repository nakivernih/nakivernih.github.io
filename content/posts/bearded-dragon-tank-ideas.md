What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for your business?
Creativity is a key factor in any business, and it can mean the difference between success and failure. Whether you’re working on a project or just thinking out loud, creativity can help you come up with innovative solutions that solve problems. But what does it really mean for your business? Here are six things to keep in mind when looking to embrace creativity: 1. It can help you attract new customers.
