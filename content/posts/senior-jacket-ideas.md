What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many to choose from. Here are a few that stand out to us:
-Start with what you know. What are your interests and passions? What do you like and don't like in the world around you? Start with that and work from there.

-Think outside the box. If you're not sure what to do, think about what other people have done or said that might be of interest to you. This can give you some great ideas for things to try or projects to take on.

Generating Ideas: Ways to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. One way is to brainstorm with others. This can be done in a group setting or by yourself. Another way to generate new ideas is to do a mind map. This is where you take a blank piece of paper and draw a circle in the middle of it. Then, you start brainstorming around the central idea, branching off into different areas. You can also look for inspiration in other places, such as books, magazines, websites, etc. If you’re stuck, try taking a walk or doing something completely unrelated to what you’re working on to clear your mind and come back fresh.
