They don’t have the same potential for change and impact as big ideas. So how do you determine which idea to pursue?

Conclusion: We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas.
We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas. If we don't, we're going to get stuck in a rut and never be able to break out of it. There are so many great ideas out there that we just can't put our finger on what to do with them all. So how do we go about finding the ones that will work for us? There are a few things that we can do in order to help ourselves get started: 
1) Take some time for yourself – We all have moments where we feel like we don't have time for anything. But if you take the time to step away from your work or project and relax, you'll usually find yourself with more inspiration than you ever thought possible. It's important to remember that if you're not taking care of yourself, you're going to suffer in the long run.

The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.
