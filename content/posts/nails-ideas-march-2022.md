Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.

How to Choose the rightDIY Project:
Choosing the right DIY project is important, especially if you want to create something for your own pleasure or use it as a learning opportunity. Here are four tips to help make the process easier:
1. Decide what you want your project to achieve. If you’re looking to make a simple change to your home or improve an existing piece of furniture, there are many possibilities out there. However, if you’re planning on creating something more comprehensive or complex, be sure to research the different types of dyes and materials before starting.

2. Consider your budget. Just because you can do something yourself doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea. Factor in both the cost of materials and the time it will take to complete your project.
