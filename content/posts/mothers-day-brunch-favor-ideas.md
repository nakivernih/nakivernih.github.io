Creative ideas can be anything from designing a cake to making a new movie. However, some of the most creative ideas come when people combine their creativity and ingenuity. For example, one person might come up with the idea of creating three-dimensional cardboard models of buildings. Another might come up with the idea of creating an artificial intelligence that can learn and innovate based on its experiences. And still another might come up with the idea of creating a computer game that is both innovative and challenging.

The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.
