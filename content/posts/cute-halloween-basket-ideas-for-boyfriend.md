How to create good ideas: What should you do to create great ideas?
Creating great ideas starts with having good ideas. There are a number of things you can do to help get started, but the most important thing is to keep focused. The most important thing is to be consistent in your efforts and not give up on your projects. There are a few things that will help you get started:
1. Engineering your thinking: This is the process of coming up with solutions and concepts that are novel and unique. It’s important to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, and then engineering your thinking in order to come up with innovative solutions.

5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.

How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.
