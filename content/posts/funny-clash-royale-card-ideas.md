Patent Applications: How do you file for an invention?
Patent applications are a common way to get your ideas out into the public domain. They can also be a way to protect your intellectual property and increase your chances of getting paid for your innovations. Here are some tips on how to file for an invention: 
- Make sure you have the proper paperwork in order to filing an application. This includes a patent application, published works, and any other supporting information. 
- Be prepared to answer many questions from researchers and patent applicants. It can be helpful to have an idea of what you're trying to create before you start filing. 
- File as soon as possible after the idea comes up in conversation or when you notice something that makes it interesting. You may not get the same response if you wait too long.
