The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation.
