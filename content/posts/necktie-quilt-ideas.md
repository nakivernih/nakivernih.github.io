How to start a blog?
If you're looking for ways to start a blog, here are some ideas to get you started. First, consider what kind of content you'd like to create. If you want to share thoughts on your work or politics, then your blog would be focused around that topic. If you want to write about life in general, maybe something like “How I Found My Love for Painting” might be more interesting. Once you have a focus, though, there are a few things to keep in mind when starting a blog. First, make sure your blog is easy to navigate and find. You don't want people trying to find your site by accident while they're browsing the internet; make sure your site is well-marked and easy to navigate. Second, make sure your content is high quality. No one wants to read an article that's full of errors or sparse information.

What are big ideas?
What are big ideas? They are new and exciting ways of looking at things that may have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. Big ideas can come from anything – a new invention, a good idea for a product, or even a new way of thinking about something.
Some big ideas might just be something you've never heard of before – like the humble computer mouse. But others might be much more familiar - like traffic congestion or how to make school smarter. It all depends on what the big idea is, and what it could bring about in terms of change.

There are many types of big ideas – some more radical than others.
