The Future of Invention: What We Can Expect from Its explosive Growth
Invention is one of the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal. It can solve some of the world's biggest problems- from developing new drugs to design new transportation systems.

Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes.
