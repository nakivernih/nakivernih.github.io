Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.

Coming Up With Ideas: Offer some tips on how to generate invention ideas.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, try to come up with ideas that solve a problem you encounter in your everyday life. Chances are, if you can find a solution to your own problem, others will be interested in your invention as well. Also, don't be afraid to brainstorm with friends or family members; two heads are better than one when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Finally, keep a notebook or journal handy at all times so you can jot down any inventive thoughts that pop into your head; you never know when inspiration will strike!

Why certain types of creativity are more successful than others?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or organization. They can be used in a number of ways, both for good and bad. Some creative ideas are more successful than others, and there are some factors that play into this success.
Some creative ideas that have been successful include the design of products, the development of new technologies, and the creating of new concepts. Other creative ideas have not been as successful, such as the development of products that are insensitive to user feedback or those that are poorly designed. It is important to consider what type of creativity is being attempted before making a decision on whether or not to pursue it.
