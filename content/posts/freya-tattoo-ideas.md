Brainstorming: How do you come up with ideas for your blog or article?
Brainstorming ideas for your blog or article can be one of the most fun and rewarding aspects of writing. Not only do you get to think up new ideas, but you also get to share your own with others. Here are a few creative ways to come up with brainstorming ideas for your next blog post or article:
1. Take on a project that you have always wanted to do but never found the time to do. This could be something as simple as creating a list of all your favorite foods from around the world, or taking on a project that has been on your radar for a while but you just haven’t had the time to dive into it.

2. Take on an existing topic and see if you can make it more creative and interesting by exploring different angles or points of view.

History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.
