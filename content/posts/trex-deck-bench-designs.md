What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different. It can be found in everything from technology to food to fashion. Innovation is what allows businesses to thrive and make a difference in the world. It can also help themarkable products and services.
But what is innovation? To many, it seems like a vague concept or something that happens behind the scenes. But innovation is actually a process that starts with a idea and runs until it’s realized. In fact, it’s often the ideas that don’t quite fit into existing models that are breakthroughs in innovation.

There are several types of innovation: product, process, service, and market research. Product innovation occurs when companies create new products or improve upon old ones. Process innovation occurs when companies come up with ways to do things better or faster than they have before.
