Conclusion: How does brainstorming work? How do you come up with great ideas? What makes good ones? Is there a difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions?
In any business, brainstorming is a process that often helps to come up with great ideas. It can be used as part of an overall strategy or as a standalone tool. The most important thing is to find the right way to use it and to make sure itâ€™s effective. There are two main types of brainstorming: formal and informal. Formal brainstorming typically takes place in a group setting and is focused on coming up with specific solutions to problems. In contrast, informal brainstorming can take place in your own time and can be more creative. It can involve anything from talking about your ideas with friends to simply coming up with your thoughts on the matter at hand. While thereâ€™s no one way to do brainstorming, using both forms will help you come up with more innovative ways to solve problems and come up with better ideas.

The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemoreâ€™s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.
