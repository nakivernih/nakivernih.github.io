Examples: When can you use creative ideas in your work?
Creative ideas are great for your work. You can use them to improve the quality of your work, or to come up with new and unique ideas. Here are a few examples:
1. Use creative ideas when you need to come up with an idea that is outside the normal. For example, you may need to come up with an idea for a story that is different from what other people have written before.

How to come up with big ideas
There’s no one answer to the question of how to come up with big ideas. But by understanding the process that goes into creating big ideas, you can better appreciate and embrace those that come your way. Here are a few tips:
1. Start with a question: What do you want to achieve?
2. Get organized: This is where things get interesting.
