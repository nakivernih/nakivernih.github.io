The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.

What are the benefits of using ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. By using them, you can improve your thinking process and come up with new ideas that may be more effective than the ones you’ve been using before. Here are six benefits of using ideas: 
1. More efficient thought: When you have a lot of ideas to think about, it becomes easier to come up with good solutions. This makes problem solving more efficient and faster, which is important for any business or project. 
2. More creativity: Ideas are often more creative than what you’ve been used to before. This is because they deal with new solutions and possibilities rather than just following the same path someone else has already taken. 
3. Easier communication: Ideas help to breaking down complex topics and making them easier for others to understand.
