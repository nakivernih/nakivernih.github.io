What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? It’s a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. They can’t explain it, but they know it exists. Brainstroming is when a person’s thoughts and ideas are constantly going through their head, like the thoughts of a machine. The problem is, nobody knows why this happens or how to stop it. Some people say that brainstroming is caused by mental exhaustion or stress, while others say it’s the result of some sort of mental enhancement. There isn’t one answer to this question, and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes brainstroming and how to stop it.

The importance of creativity in education
Since the dawn of time, creativity has been an integral part of human existence. It is what has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species. Today, more than ever, creativity is essential for success in all aspects of life.
In education, creativity is just as important as anything else. It allows students to think outside the box, to find new and innovative solutions to problems, and to express themselves in unique ways.

Unfortunately, creativity is often stifled in traditional educational settings. Too much emphasis is placed on conformity and rote learning, instead of encouraging students to explore their own creative potential. This needs to change if we want our children to be successful in an increasingly competitive world.

The power of suggestion:
Creative people are often able to think of new ideas that would never have occurred to others. Some of the most famous creative minds in history, such as Beowulf and Michelangelo, were not born with a natural talent for creativity.

Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.
