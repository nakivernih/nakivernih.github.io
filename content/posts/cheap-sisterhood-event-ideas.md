How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.

How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.
