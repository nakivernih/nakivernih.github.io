What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everything. Whether you’re looking to come up with new ways to market your business, come up with unique and original designs for your home or just need a creative brainstorm, there’s no shortage of ideas available. Here are five creative ideas that can help get you started:
1. Create a social media account and share your latest projects and progress on Twitter and Instagram. This will let other creatives know what you’re up to, and it can also be used as an opportunity to show off your work in a more public way.

2. Collaborate with fellow entrepreneurs and investors in order to develop a business plan or strategy. This will help you understand where your business is headed, as well as give you some idea of what kind of investment resources might be available to you.

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
