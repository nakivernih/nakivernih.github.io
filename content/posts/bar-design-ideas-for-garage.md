Conclusion: What advice would you give to someone interested in the future of technology?
There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today: 
-Virtual Reality: This could be used for training or for real-world applications such as medical surgery. It's already being used in games and allows users to feel as if they are within the game or the application itself. 

-Augmented Reality: This allows users to see what they're looking at with more detail than ever before. Augmented Reality can also be used for marketing purposes, since it can give people an idea of what products they might want to buy.

What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.
