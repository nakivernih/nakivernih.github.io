Ideas as fuel for creativity: why you need them and how to use them
Creativity is a precious commodity and it can be hard to find the right ideas to help you get started. Here are 5 ways to use creativity to fuel your creativity:
1. Get inspired by other people or objects. view images of famous landmarks, paintings, sculptures, or even everyday items and come up with creative ideas for them.

2. Find a problem that you’re struggling with and solve it using creative thinking. This can be anything from coming up with a new design for a product to coming up with an idea for a restaurant that sells healthy food.

3. Take advantage of your natural creativity by brainstorming problems that don’t have an easily solved solution. This could include ideas for new products, products that are harder to find, or even ideas for new business concepts.
