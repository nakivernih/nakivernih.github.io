What are the new ideas out there?
There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision: 
-Start by asking yourself what you want your project to achieve. If you don’t know yet, consider including goals and target audience in your design.
-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
-Finally, consider how much money or time you’ll need to spend on developing the idea before making a decision. If it’s something you think will cost less than both of those things combined, go for it!

conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.
