Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.

Ideas for the environment: How can we conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment?
The future of the environment is important to all of us, and we need to find ways to conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment. Here are some ideas for the environment in 2022: 
1. Use organic materials when possible. This includes not just food, but also products made with natural ingredients. It can be tough to make this switch, but it’s worth it in the long run. 
2. Vehicle emissions need to be reduced. This will require concerted effort from both the government and businesses, but it’s something that we can achieve if we work together. 
3. Reduce energy use in homes and businesses. This can be done by retrofitting buildings or installing more efficient equipment. It’s important to take small steps rather than making drastic changes all at once, though. 
4. Foster a sustainable agriculture industry.
