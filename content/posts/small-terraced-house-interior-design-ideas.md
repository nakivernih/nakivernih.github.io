Elements of grammar: What is a sentence, and how does it work?
A sentence is an individual unit of communication. It is a group of words that are put together to create a thought or statement. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one key feature- they are all complete sentences. There are two main types of sentence- the opening sentence, and the closing sentence. The opening sentence is the beginning of a piece of text, and it sets the tone for the rest of the story. The closing sentence is the end of a piece of text, and it summarizes what has happened so far. There are many different ways to build a sentence, but all preserves these common features: Each word must be completed with a letter from A to Z, and there must be an ending consonant after every other letter. There are also certain rules that govern how words can be spelled- these rules are called grammar rules.

Tips for post formatting and design:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your article to say. What topics do you want to cover? How do you want people to feel after reading it? Do you want it to be a tutorial, an overview, or a comprehensive guide?

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.
