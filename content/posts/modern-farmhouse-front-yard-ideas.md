Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but its meaning can be difficult to define. When asked to define innovation, most people will give a general and vague answer. The true definition of innovation is much more specific.
Innovation can be defined as the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a reality. It is the implementation of a new or improved solution that solves a problem or meets a need. Innovation involves creativity, but it also requires resourcefulness, planning, and execution.

There are many different types of innovation, but all share one common goal: to make something better. Whether itâ€™s a new product, process, or service, innovation strives to improve upon what already exists. Sometimes this means coming up with an entirely new solution, and other times it means making small improvements to existing solutions.
