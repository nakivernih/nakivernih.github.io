Invention: Limitations of invention
Invention limitations are a key concern for the modern age. Invention has played an important role in human society, and this is only expected to continue as technology advances. However, there are some areas where invention can be limited, which can have a significant impact on the economy and society. One such limitation is that innovation often begins with ideas and not with physical products or services. It is also important to note that new ideas often come from people who are not experts in their field and must work hard to develop them into a product or service that can be used by others.

what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.
