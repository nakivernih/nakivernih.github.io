How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.

Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from regularity?
Creativity is the ability of a person to come up with new and innovative ways to do something. It can be defined in many different ways, but in general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. This varies from person to person, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a definition. However, some key definitions of creativity include: • Artistry: The quality or practice of producing creative works • Innovation: Coming up with anew or novel solutions to problems or challenges • Creativity Loop: A continually evolving process that leads to new ideas and results 
What makes creativity so special? One major factor is that it doesn't always have a standard definition. Unlike regularity, creativity doesn't just involve coming up with new things- it can also involve coming up with ideas that are impossible to accomplish by any other means.
