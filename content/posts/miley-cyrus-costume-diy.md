2022: What are the new ideas for businesses in 2022?
There are many new ideas for businesses in 2022, including ones that focus on digital marketing, artificial intelligence, and reconfiguration of workforces. Some of the most promising concepts include: 
1. The rise of "Intelligent Manufacturing" - companies that use machine learning and algorithms to optimize production runs and produce more quickly and cheaply. This could lead to a significant increase in jobs in the manufacturing sector, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor.
