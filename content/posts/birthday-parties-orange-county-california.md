For consumers, innovation can mean finding new ways to purchase or use products or services.

The Problem: How do we create meaningful ideas?
In order to create meaningful ideas, we need a strong understanding of what those ideas mean and how to put those ideas into practice. Unfortunately, most people lack these foundational skills. In order to get started, here are some basic tips: 
1. Think about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you determine how your idea can be used and adapted. 
2. Brainstorm with others for feedback andIdea generation challenges can be fun, but also helpful in getting feedback on whether or not your idea is conceptually good or bad. 
3. Come up with a working title for your idea before you even start thinking about it. This will give you an idea of what the word “idea” means and make sure that everyone who hears your idea understands it at its purest form (i.e., without any additional context).

Conclusion: Why should businesses invest in innovation?
Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve and stay competitive. Innovation can be found in anything from technology to marketing. However, businesses that are Continuously Innovation-Minded will see a return on investment (ROI) much sooner than those that aren’t. To be continuously innovative, businesses must have a clear idea of what they want to create and then make sure they can actually achieve it. This requires significant resources and time, but with the right attitude and strategies, businesses can reap the rewards of innovation sooner rather than later.
