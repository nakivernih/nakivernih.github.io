What are big ideas?
Big ideas are what get people thinking and sparking new ideas. By definition, big ideas are those that are difficult or impossible to imagine, but which offer a great potential for solving a problem. They can come from anywhere, in any field, and can range from the small to the large. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A new way to make money: This could be anything from starting a small business to developing a new technology.

2. A better way to care for your health: This could include things like finding a way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins or developing more effective medical treatments.

3. A new way of transportation: This could include anything from building an electric vehicle to creating a flying car.

4. The finished Product: How does the finished product stack up against other options?
When looking at options for homebuilding, it can be hard to decide which one is the best for you. Whether you're looking to start a home from scratch or just update an existing one, there are a number of different options available.
