Why big ideas are important: What are the benefits of having a big idea?
There are multiple benefits to having a big idea. A big idea can help you solve a problem that is causing you inconvenience, it can help you create something new and exciting, or it can help you improve your business. There are several reasons why having a big idea could be important for your business. Here are just a few: 
1) A big idea can give your business more visibility. If you have a big idea that is unique and interesting, people will be more likely to hear about it and try out your product or service. This will lead to more sales, and more profits for your business. 
2) It can increase the chances of success. If you have a big idea that is well-thought out and well executed, then you increased the chances of success because it will be easier for others to replicate or improve upon your ideas.

Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.
