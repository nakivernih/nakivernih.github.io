How Invention Works: Invention can come from anything from a simple change in the way something works to creating a new product or technology.
Invention is the process of creating a new product or technology from something that already exists. It can come from a simple change in the way something works, or from creating a new market for an existing product. In both cases, innovation can mean big changes for both those who create it and society as a whole.

The drawbacks of brainstorming
In a work environment, brainstorming is often thought of as a go-to method for generating new ideas. However, there are several drawbacks to this technique that can make it less effective than other methods.
One drawback is that brainstorming can lead to groupthink. This phenomenon occurs when people in a group tend to conform to the same thinking pattern in order to avoid conflict. This can stifle creativity and prevent different perspectives from being heard.

Another issue with brainstorming is that it can be difficult to generate ideas when everyone is focused on the same task. When people are talking over each other and trying to come up with ideas at the same time, it can be difficult to have an organized and productive discussion.

Finally, brainstorming sessions can often be dominated by a few extroverted individuals.

Brainstroming is a mental process that helps to focus and organize thoughts. It can be used in both personal and professional settings. The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what youâ€™ve assigned to those thoughts.

In spite of its many forms, creativity is often thought of as a single-minded pursuit. But that's not always accurate. Creative art can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their skill level or creativity levels.
