How to come up with new ideas
The best way to come up with new ideas is by thinking about what people already do. You can ask yourselves questions like, "What does this activity do that differentiates it from the others I've tried?" or "What are some potential uses for this new concept?" By doing this, you'll be able to come up with concepts that would be both unique and interesting.
