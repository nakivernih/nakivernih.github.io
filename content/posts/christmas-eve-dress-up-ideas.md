The history of invention: Discuss the origins of invention and how it has changed over time.
Invention is the process of bringing ideas or objects together in a new way. It is often seen as the first step in creating something new, and it has been an important part of human history since the beginning.
The first inventions were probably simple tools and devices that made everyday tasks easier. Over time, more complex inventions were developed, such as the wheel and the printing press. In the Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid change in technology and manufacturing, many new inventions were created, such as the steam engine and the cotton gin.

Today, invention is still an important part of society. New technologies are constantly being developed, and many companies invest heavily in research and development to create new products. Invention is also becoming more democratized thanks to tools like 3D printers and open-source hardware platforms that make it easier for people to create their own products.

The creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come from a variety of places within the individual. They can come from inspirations, ideas stemming from one's own life experiences, or even just things that strike the individual as fun or interesting. 
There are a few key things that go into creating creative ideas. The first is to have some sort of starting point. This can be anything from an idea for a project to inspiration for your next painting or poem.
