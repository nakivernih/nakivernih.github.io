creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent
Inevitably, every invention will not be perfect. That’s okay! The important thing is that you keep trying and learning until you find something that works well and can be improved upon. Keep a notebook or digital sketchbook where you can jot down ideas as they come to you, so you have access to them when needed. This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.
