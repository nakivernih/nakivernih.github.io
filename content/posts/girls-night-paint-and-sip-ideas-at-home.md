Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Don’t steal other people’s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
2) Use your imagination. When you come up with creative ideas, don’t just think about what might work – try out different scenarios and see what comes up.
3) Get feedback from others. Take the time to ask people who have experience with the product or problem you’re thinking of solving how they would approach it. This will help you develop your idea into something that is both effective and appealing to potential customers.

Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways. 
One common definition of innovation is "the use of new ideas, methods and approaches to solve problems." This definition includes many different aspects to innovation, including business models, product design, marketing strategy and even customer service. It's important to note that innovation doesn't have to happen only in the context of business; it can also occur within individual teams or startups. 

The most distinguishing feature of innovation is its impact on society. Innovation can mean different things for different industries, but one thing that's always included is the idea of creating value for others.
