How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?

How innovation benefits society:
Innovation benefits society by increasing productivity, innovation reducing costs, and improving the quality of products. Productivity is the amount of work done per hour. Reducing costs is the lowering of prices or the reduction in cost of producing a good or service. Improving quality is the improvement of something that does not meet all expectations, for example a product that is not as effective as it should be. Innovation can be thought of as any change in how something is done, from making a new product to changing how services are provided.
