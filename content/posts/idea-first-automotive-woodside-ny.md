Definitions of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are better than those in existence. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one way is by looking at it as a way to improve something existing in the market. This can be done through designing a new product, developing a new technology, or even coming up with a new way of doing things. All of these innovation efforts can result in significantly different products and services being offered to the market.

Thesis: What are some new ideas that could help improve our lives?
There are many new ideas that could help improve our lives, but one idea that has been gaining a lot of attention is the so-called “smart home”. This is a concept where consumers can access various services and devices in their homes through a network of connected devices. Smart home technologies have the potential to improve our lives by allowing us to control our environments more effectively, save time and money, and reduce stress. Here are four examples of how smart home technologies could help improve our lives.
1. Automatic noise cancellation: Automated noise cancellation technology can help reduce background noise during activities such as sleep or work.
