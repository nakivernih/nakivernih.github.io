The purpose of creativity: What does it achieve?
Creativity has been variously defined as the ability to think out of the box, come up with new ideas, or express yourself in a new way. In some cases creativity is simply a tool that can be used to achieve a desired outcome. However, there is another purpose for creativity – the art of creative expression. This type of creativity is often overlooked but can have a significant impact on people and businesses.
