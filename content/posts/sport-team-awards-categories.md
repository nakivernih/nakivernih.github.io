Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.

Ideas for the environment: How can we conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment?
The future of the environment is important to all of us, and we need to find ways to conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment. Here are some ideas for the environment in 2022: 
1. Use organic materials when possible. This includes not just food, but also products made with natural ingredients. It can be tough to make this switch, but it’s worth it in the long run. 
2. Vehicle emissions need to be reduced. This will require concerted effort from both the government and businesses, but it’s something that we can achieve if we work together. 
3. Reduce energy use in homes and businesses. This can be done by retrofitting buildings or installing more efficient equipment. It’s important to take small steps rather than making drastic changes all at once, though. 
4. Foster a sustainable agriculture industry.
