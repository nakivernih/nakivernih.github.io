Overcoming Obstacles: How to overcome obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere, at any time. The key is to recognize them and act on them. However, there are some obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea. Here are a few tips on how to overcome those obstacles:
1) Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

2) Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the area you're interested in. They may have some great insights that you hadn't considered before.

3) Don't get discouraged if your first few ideas aren't winners. Edison famously said that he didn't fail, he just found 10,000 ways that didn't work. Every "failure" brings you one step closer to success.
