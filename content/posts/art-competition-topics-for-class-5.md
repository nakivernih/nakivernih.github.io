2022: What are the new ideas for businesses in 2022?
There are many new ideas for businesses in 2022, including ones that focus on digital marketing, artificial intelligence, and reconfiguration of workforces. Some of the most promising concepts include: 
1. The rise of "Intelligent Manufacturing" - companies that use machine learning and algorithms to optimize production runs and produce more quickly and cheaply. This could lead to a significant increase in jobs in the manufacturing sector, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. 
2. How AI is changing the way we interact with our environment - through things like 3D printing or autonomous vehicles. These changes could have serious implications for businesses, as they could create new opportunities for cost overruns, bottlenecks, and performance problems.

Origins of Invention: How did people come up with ideas for new products and services?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that has not been tried before. It can be an idea for a new toy, a new way to make your product or service more marketable, or even a new way to do your business. Inventions are often based on something that someone else has already done, which allows people to start from scratch and come up with ideas that could be successful.
