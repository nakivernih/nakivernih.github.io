Find a passion: What makes you happy?
Are you sick of being stuck in the same routine? Do you want to start living your life with a sense of purpose and meaning? If so, there are a few passions that could help you find happiness. Here are six reasons why you should start exploring interests outside of your comfort zone: 
1. You can be creative. There is no need to be afraid to experiment and try something new if you have a passion for life. You can explore all sorts of hobbies, art styles, and career paths that could make you happy. 
2. You can learn things. A passion for learning can be a great way to find happiness because it gives you something to focus on other than yourself. Learning about new topics or people can give you insight into your own personality and identity that can make you happier. 
3. You can connect with others.

Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.

The power of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is a state of mind, it's ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. People who are creative often have an idea for something that they don't know how to do but they get stuck on how to make it a reality. One reason creativity is so important is because without creativity, there would be no innovation in the world. It can be difficult to be creative at times, but with practice you can become one of the most creative people around.
