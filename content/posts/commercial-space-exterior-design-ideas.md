Creative ideas can be anything that makes someone happy. Whether it’s a new hobby, a new way of looking at the world, or just something to get them thinking, creativity is a must in any creative person’s life. Here are some fun creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take on a new challenge: When you feel like you can’t seem to do anything right, take on a new challenge and see if you can do it better than anyone else. This could be as simple as painting or sculpting an expression out of marble, or coming up with your own unique idea for an art project. 
2. Get organized: When you feel lost in your thoughts or don’t know where to start, getting organized will help you find your way back home.

The brainstroming phenomenon is a term used to describe a mental state in which a person has high levels of focus and concentration on one thing. Brainstroming can be described as being in a "zombie zone." This state can be caused by a variety of reasons such as stress, boredom, or fatigue. When the mind is focused on just one thing, it is difficult to move on from that focus.

The History of Innovation:
Innovation is the process of expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Innovation occurs when a new idea or approach to solving a problem is proposed, and then tested and implemented. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. Research and development – This refers to the development of new products or services that are Pirandello-like in their concept but with real world application possibilities. It can be done through trials and prototypes, as well as product launches.

2. Creative destruction – This refers to the process by which ideas, concepts, or technologies that have been tried and failed before are resurrected and given a second chance. They may be used in combination, or they may be abandoned altogether after experiencing negative results.
