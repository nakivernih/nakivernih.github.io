Some inventions are so important that they have caused entire civilizations to change. Others are simply nifty gadgets that few people ever encounter. But no invention is without its challenges. Each new invention presents new opportunities and threats to society, and scientists working on new technologies must constantly weigh the risks and rewards of their work against the potential consequences of their innovations.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.
