History of innovation:
The history of innovation is filled with stories of people who have inspired and changed the way we live and work. Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.
