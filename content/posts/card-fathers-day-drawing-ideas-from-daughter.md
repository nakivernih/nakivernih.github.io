What is big ideas?
Big Ideas are the seeds of new ideas and they can be anything from a simple change to something that has never been done before. Here are 8 examples of big ideas: 
1. Let people pay for their own health care. 
2. Get rid of student loan debt. 
3. Create a national energy policy that is environmentally friendly. 
4. Re-balance the U.S budget so that it spends less on defense and more on education, infrastructure, and green transportation projects. 
5. Do away with food stamps and welfare as we know them and create a system where individuals receive income based on results rather than need or dependency.
