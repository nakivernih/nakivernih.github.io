Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

Use of inventions in business: Why is this important?
invention ideas are important because they can help businesses save time and money. By using inventions, businesses can improve their products or services, slashed costs, and increased innovation. Here are three examples of how inventions have helped businesses: 
1. A key to a successful cosmetics company was the development of a new shade of lipstick that could be worn in all light colors. This led to the development of other popular shades, as well as new products such as lip balms and foundation kits. 
2. Another example is the development of a time-saving coffee maker that used drip coffee instead of pods. This led to lower costs for coffee and more efficient manufacturing processes.
3. The development of an air conditioning unit has allowed homes to be cooled much faster than previously possible. This has saved lives, particularly during summer heat waves.
