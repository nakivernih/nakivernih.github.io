Why big ideas are important
Big ideas are important because they can help change the world.

Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

The Relationship of Art to Life: What is the purpose of art?
Creative art has a variety of purposes, some of which are more specific than others. For example, music is often used as a form of art to express emotions and thoughts. This can be done in a number of ways, including through the creation of songs or through dance. It can also be used to tell stories or to explore ideas about the human experience. In addition, creative art is often used as an outlet for people who don't have any other means of expression. This can include artists who are struggling with mental health issues, artists who are homeless or those who have no other way to share their ideas and feelings. There are many purposes for creative art and it ultimately depends on the individual's needs and wants.
