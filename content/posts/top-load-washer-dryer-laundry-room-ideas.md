What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche.

Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.
