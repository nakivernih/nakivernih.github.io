What are some new ideas to consider?
There are many new ideas to consider when it comes to mental health, such as creating a support system for those with mental illness, expanding access to substances that can help reduce symptoms, and developing treatments specifically tailored to the needs of people withmental illness. Here are some other ideas that may be worth exploring:
1. Create a support system for those with mental illness. There is a wealth of information available online and in books about how to create one, but often people don't have the time or resources to do so. A good way to start is by finding a support group for those with mental illness who are not currently using services. This can be done through online social networks or through local organizations.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.
