Brainstroming is the process of thinking about a topic excessively and not completing any tasks. This can lead to a lack of productivity and an overall feeling of being overwhelmed.

Creative abilities: What are they and how do they differ from other abilities?
Creative abilities can be defined in many different ways, but the most commonly accepted definition is that creativity is a quality or state of being that enables people to come up with new and innovative ideas. This ability can differ from person to person, but typically it refers to a spark of inspiration or an idea that comes to mind.
There are several different ways creative abilities can be measured, including creative thinking tests and creative writing exercises. However, the most common way to measure creativity is through art or poetry. This is because art has the ability to stir emotions and evoke feelings in people, which can then be used as a measure of creativity.

There are also several other abilities that may contribute to creativity, such as problem-solving skills, listening skills, and communication skills. However, these Abilities do not typically go hand in hand with creativity.
