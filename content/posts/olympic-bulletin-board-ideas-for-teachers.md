Creative expression: What are the different forms of creative expression?
Creative expression is any form of art that is created for the express purpose of communicating, educating, entertain, or moving someone. It can be in the form of music, painting, sculpture, design, writing, or anything that is creative and expresses an idea or emotion. There are many different forms of creative expression and each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few examples: 
• Music: Music can be expressed in many ways, but one of the most popular forms is songwriting. Songwriters create lyrics and melodies based on their personal experiences and ideas. This allows them to focus on directly expressing their songs’ messages without worrying about censorship or repercusiveness. 

• Painting: Painting is another popular form of creative expression. Artists use a range of colors and mediums to create unique sculptures and paintings that explore different aspects of life.

Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.
