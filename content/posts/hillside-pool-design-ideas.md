Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artist’s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.
