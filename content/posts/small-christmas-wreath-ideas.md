1) Shred or cut everything before you start. This will help keep things organized and make it easier to wrap up.
2) Take your time. Do your project one step at a time and be patient. You'll be glad you did!
3) Get organized. Make a plan and stick to it. This will help keep everything under control and make the wrapping process easier.
4) Label everything! Not only will this help when wrapping up, but it will also remind you what's what when it comes time to move on to the next project.
