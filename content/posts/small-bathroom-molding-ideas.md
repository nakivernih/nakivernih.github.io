What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that makes someone happy. Whether it’s a new hobby, a new way of looking at the world, or just something to get them thinking, creativity is a must in any creative person’s life. Here are some fun creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take on a new challenge: When you feel like you can’t seem to do anything right, take on a new challenge and see if you can do it better than anyone else. This could be as simple as painting or sculpting an expression out of marble, or coming up with your own unique idea for an art project. 
2. Get organized: When you feel lost in your thoughts or don’t know where to start, getting organized will help you find your way back home.
