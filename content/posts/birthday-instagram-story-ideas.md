How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

Tips for post formatting and design:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your article to say. What topics do you want to cover? How do you want people to feel after reading it? Do you want it to be a tutorial, an overview, or a comprehensive guide?
2. Choose the right style for your article. There are many different ways to write an article, and there is no one style that is best for all situations. You can use a simple, straight-forward layout or you can go for something more experimental and stylish.

3. Use formatting features wisely. When writing articles, always use grammar and punctuation correctly. This will help readers understand your piece and stay on target throughout the entire process.

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.

What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.
