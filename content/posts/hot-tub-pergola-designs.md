How to create a positive customer experience
Creating a positive customer experience is not only important for your business, but also for your own personal satisfaction. Here are some tips to help make your customer experience more positive:
1. Keep your customers close by. When possible, keep your customers close to you and give them personalized service. This will create a feeling of warmth and connection with you, which will make them want to come back.

2. Be patient. Don't take things too quickly or you'll lose the trust of your customers. Instead, work slowly and steadily to build up a relationship with them. This will give you time to understand them and learn their needs.

3. Make sure you're listening attentively. Not only do it show that you care about what they have to say, but it can also help improve the quality of conversations when trying to sell something or provide support.

Conclusion: How does creativity work and how can we use it to our advantage?
Creativity is an important part of any business. By using creativity, businesses can come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can help businesses reach new heights in their industry or achieve specific goals. Here are a few tips on how to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Ideas are not came from a vacuum; they come from what you have in your periphery. When you start taking things apart and looking at them from other angles, you will get more creative ideas. This is especially true when it comes to brainstorming – by breaking things down into smaller pieces, you are more likely to come up with multiple different solutions that may be better for the company. 

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks; if something feels unorthodox or risky, it is likely because it is.
