creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, donâ€™t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.

What is brainstroming and why is it important?
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the phenomenon of increased focus and productivity during periods of intense thought or concentration. Brainstroming is often seen as a benefit to people who are able to keep their minds focused on one task for more than a short period of time. Some believe that brainstroming can be used to improve problem solving, creativity, and decision making. However, there are several caveats to note when it comes to brainstroming. First, brainstroming can be difficult to maintain for any length of time; second, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving maximal effectiveness; and third, individuals respond differently to different types of brainstroming interventions.
