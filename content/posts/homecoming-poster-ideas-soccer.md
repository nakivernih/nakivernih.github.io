The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity.

Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldnâ€™t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way. Finally, is objective is where youumberofideasyougeneratedbeforecomingupwiththefinalobjective.
