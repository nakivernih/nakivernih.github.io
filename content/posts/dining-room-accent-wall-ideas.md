Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service, or concept that is different from the traditional ones. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one way is to say that it is a change in approach or approach to something. Innovation can also refer to changes in the way products are produced, used, or marketed. In some cases, innovation may just mean changing the way something is done instead of creating a new product.
