Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation.
