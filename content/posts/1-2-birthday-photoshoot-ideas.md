The importance of creativity in education
Since the dawn of time, creativity has been an integral part of human existence. It is what has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species. Today, more than ever, creativity is essential for success in all aspects of life.
In education, creativity is just as important as anything else. It allows students to think outside the box, to find new and innovative solutions to problems, and to express themselves in unique ways.

Unfortunately, creativity is often stifled in traditional educational settings. Too much emphasis is placed on conformity and rote learning, instead of encouraging students to explore their own creative potential. This needs to change if we want our children to be successful in an increasingly competitive world.
