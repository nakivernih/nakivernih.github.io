How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.
