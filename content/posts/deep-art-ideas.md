Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.
