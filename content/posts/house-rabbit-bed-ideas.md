How do we create new ideas?
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.
2. Take on a challenge: Taking on a challenge is another way to create new ideas. Often, when you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, you’ll come up with better ideas than if you hadn’t taken the challenge.
3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.
