The difference between creativity and inspiration: What are some of the benefits of having more creativity?
Creativity is a term often used to describe different aspects of one’s life. It can be used to describe things like coming up with new ideas, or coming up with solutions to problems. Inspiration, on the other hand, is a more specific word that refers to a feeling or emotion that one experiences when looking at something and thinking about how it could be improved.
There are several benefits of having more inspiration in one’s life. For example, inspiration can help you come up with new ideas and strategies for solving problems. It can also help you feel more motivated and inspired when working on projects. In addition, inspiration can help you become more creative in your own artwork and writing. Finally, inspiration can help you develop your overall business idea or concept.

The Creative Process: How do you get started?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the most successful creative projects always start with a few key premises.

Whatever the starting point, however, it’s important to keep things simple and focus on the task at hand. After all, creativity is about seeing things in a different light and coming up with new ways of seeing things.
