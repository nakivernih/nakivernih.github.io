The Power of Idea: How do we get the most out of our ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business and creativity. From businesses to creativity, ideas can be the key to success. Here are five tips on how to get the most out of your ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.

Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you donâ€™t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.
