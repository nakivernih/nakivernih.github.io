What are the benefits of using ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. By using them, you can improve your thinking process and come up with new ideas that may be more effective than the ones you’ve been using before. Here are six benefits of using ideas: 
1. More efficient thought: When you have a lot of ideas to think about, it becomes easier to come up with good solutions. This makes problem solving more efficient and faster, which is important for any business or project. 
2. More creativity: Ideas are often more creative than what you’ve been used to before. This is because they deal with new solutions and possibilities rather than just following the same path someone else has already taken. 
3. Easier communication: Ideas help to breaking down complex topics and making them easier for others to understand.

1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.
