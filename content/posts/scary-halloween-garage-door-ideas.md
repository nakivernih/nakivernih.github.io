Benefits of invention: How does an idea create value for someone?
Inventions can create value for their creators in many ways, from making a profit to improving the quality of life. But what happens when an invention is created by someone who has no idea what it will do?

But even if the inventor doesn't have any idea what their invention will do, they still have a right to reap the benefits of their hard work. And there are plenty of those benefits - plenty of people are willing to pay money for products that are created using ideas and innovations.

Origin of Invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that was not originally planned or conceived by someone else. It can be anything from building a new computer to creating a new type of sauce. Inventions have been around for centuries, but their origins are still unknown. One possible explanation for the birth of invention is that somebody came up with the idea in their head and then put it into practice. Another theory suggests that somebody else helped develop the original idea before it was put into action. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question – each person’s experience and knowledge will likely differ on how they came up with the original product or idea.
