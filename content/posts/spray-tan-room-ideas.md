The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

The benefits of having Big Ideas.
There are a number of benefits to having big ideas, from increasing creativity and innovation to improving productivity and motivation. Here are four ways in which big ideas can help you achieve your goals: 
1. By definition, a big idea is something that is much larger than what has been done before. This can help you think outside the box, and allow you to come up with new and exciting ideas that may not have been possible before. 
2. Big ideas can also be more challenging than average, which can give you an opportunity to see how far you can push yourself and try new things. This could mean that if you’re looking for a project to work on that’s both challenging and innovative, a big idea might be the perfect fit for you.
