The importance of creativity: What are we trying to accomplish with creativity?
Creativity is important in many ways. It allows people to come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can be used to improve personal relationships and businesses. However, without proper creativity, some things may not go as planned. For example, if a business does not have fresh and innovative ideas, their customers may be less likely to return or recommend them to others. In order to create lasting memories and successes, businesses must start by cultivating creativity in their employees and directors.
