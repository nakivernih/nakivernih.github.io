Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the driving force behind progress. It has led to the creation of technologies that have made our lives easier and more enjoyable. It is a process that involves the generation of new ideas, the development of those ideas into a plan or prototype, and the testing and refinement of the prototype. Inventors are people who are able to see beyond the status quo and imagine something better. They are creative problem-solvers who are always looking for ways to improve upon existing products or create entirely new ones. The invention process can be long and arduous, but the rewards can be great. Those who are successful in inventing something that makes a difference in the world can achieve fame and fortune.

Creative process: How does the creative process work, and how does it differ from other forms of intelligence?
Creative process: How does it work?
There is no one answer to this question as the creative process is different for everyone. However, there are some general principles that can be followed to help create valuable and successful products or ideas. 

The creative process begins with the idea or concept. This can be anything from a question that needs to be answered to a plan of how something should be done. From here, it is up to the individual to decide whether they want to pursue the idea or not. If they do, they will need some help in order to turn it into a reality. This includes coming up with a name, designing the prototype, and making sure everything is ready for production. Once all of these steps are complete, it is finally up to the customer or user to test and give feedback before finalizing their decision.

Creativity and professionalism: How do you use creativity in your job?
Creativity and professionalism are two important aspects of any job. If you want to be a successful artist, you need to be able to come up with creative ideas. If you want to be a professional doctor, you also need to be able to come up with innovative ways to help patients. In both cases, creativity and professionalism are essential.
If you want your work to look professional, you need to use creativity as often as possible. For example, when brainstorming new ideas for a product or company, always include some creative ideas in your mind. Even if they’re not exactly what you’re thinking of right now, working on some creative projects will help make your work look more polished and professional.

Ultimately, being creative and professional is important in any career.
