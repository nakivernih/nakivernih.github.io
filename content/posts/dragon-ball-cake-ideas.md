Tools and Materials: What kind of tools or materials do you need to complete a project?
When starting a project, there are always different tools and materials needed. However, depending on the project you are working on, different tools and materials might be necessary.  For example, when building a house, you may need some tools to build the wall or home.  Additionally, if you are doing a project that requires welding or other heavy-duty work, you will need some special tools or materials to complete the task.   A project also depends on the type of tool or material used. For example, building a car may require metalworking tools like hammers and saws to cut through wood.
