Definition of Innovation: How can it be used in business?
Innovation is the process of designing, testing, and deploying new products or services that improve customer experience or competitive advantage. The word “innovation” has been used to describe everything from new products to better ways to do business.
There are a few key aspects to innovation that businesses should consider when implementing it in their business. One is that innovation should be based on solving customer problems and not just creating new products. Innovation can also come from developing new processes and technology, as well as expanding existing ones. Another key factor is whether the innovation will cannibalize current sales or help grow them. Finally, innovation must be cost effective in order to be worthwhile for businesses.

With all of these factors in mind, it can be difficult to know what type of innovation is best for your business.
