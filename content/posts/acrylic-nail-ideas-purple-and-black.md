Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.

Types of creativity:
Creativity is a broad term that can refer to any activity or feeling that leads to unique and original ideas. There are many different types of creativity, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: visual creativity, auditory creativity, and kinesthetic creativity.
Visual creativity is often measured by how much creative ideas the individual can come up with in a short amount of time. This type of creativity is often associated with art, fashion, and design. Visual artists may use various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, graphics, photography, and 3D printing to create their output.

Auditory creativity is often measured by how well the individual can generate new sounds. This type of creativity often occurs when someone listens to music or takes part in creative activities that produce new sounds.
