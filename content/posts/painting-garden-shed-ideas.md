What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

How to Take Advantage of Ideas: How can you take advantage of ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool for businesses and people. They can help you solve problems, get ideas for new products or services, and come up with new ways of doing things. However, taking advantage of ideas can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you make the most of your ideas: 
1. Make sure you have an idea for what you want to create. If you don't have an idea for what you want to do, it won't be easy to come up with a great way to put your idea into practice. 
2. Do your research before starting something. Once you have an idea for something, it's important to do some research so that you're not wasting time and money on something that doesn't have a lot of potential. 
3. Be patient.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
