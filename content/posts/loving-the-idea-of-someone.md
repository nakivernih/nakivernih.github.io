Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

Why creativity is important: What does it mean for business and life?
Creativity is important for business and life. It can mean new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply a different perspective on an old problem. In most cases, creativity is essential for businesses and people to continue their momentum and grow in their careers. However, it can also be dangerous to rely exclusively on creativity alone to solve problems, as it can quickly become exhausted and stale. There are a few factors that help to keep creativity fresh and ongoing, and these are key to success in any field: having a diverse range of ideas, keeping our imaginations active by letting them roam free, developing our creative abilities over time, being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, and always looking for ways to improve upon what we’ve done before.
