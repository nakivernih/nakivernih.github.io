Invention: What are the four ways that invention happens?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not currently existing. Invention occurs in many different ways, but four are particularly important: Creative Art, Technology, Business and Science. 
Creative Art occurs when people come up with new ideas or designs that they never would have thought of before. This can be done through brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, or even just looking at something and thinking of potential solutions. Technology happens when scientists find new ways to make things work better and faster. Business happens when companies decide how to use their invention and create products that people will want to buy. Science happens when scientists figure out how things work and learn how to make them work better.

The benefits of creative art: How does creativity benefit us?
Creativity has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, from helping people feel more creative and motivated, to improving our thinking and problem solving skills. However, there are also a number of other benefits that can come from creativity. Here are just a few: 
1. Increased understanding of complex topics. When people are able to understand complex concepts more clearly, they are better able to solve problems and make decisions. This is especially true when it comes to matters of the arts, as understanding how an image or painting is composed can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. 

2. Increased expression and communication. People who are more creative often have more natural communication abilities than those who aren’t. This is because creativity helps us express ourselves in a way that is both original and interesting.

The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artist’s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.
