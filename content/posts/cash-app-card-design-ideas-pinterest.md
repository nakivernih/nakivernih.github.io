The benefits to creativity: How does creativity help us achieve our goals?
Creativity is frequently seen as one of the biggest benefits to having a creative mind. It can help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively, and it can also help you develop new skills. Here are some of the most common reasons why creativity is so beneficial: 
1. It can increase brainstorming and problem-solving abilities.

When you have a lot of ideas floating around in your head, creativity can help you come up with a solution that's more likely to work. And when it comes to problem-solving, creativity can be an asset – it's often better than relying on pre-determined solutions. 

2. It can make you faster learners.

One of the best things about creativity is that it gives you the opportunity to learn quickly and assimilate new information.

What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.
