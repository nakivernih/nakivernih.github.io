Effects of innovation on society and businesses: How does innovation impact economic development?
Innovation is a key factor that has had a positive impact on society and businesses over the years. Some of the benefits include increased production, efficiency, and competitiveness. However, there are also potential negative impacts that can arise from innovation. For example, it can lead to new products or services being created that are not as desirable or successful as those that have been before. In addition, it can also lead to changes in the way business is conducted – for example, through the introduction of new methods or tools. This can have a significant impact on company profits and employee productivity.

How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.
