The future of creative art: What changes are likely to occur in the future and why?
Creative art has been around for centuries and is a key part of many cultures. However, with the advent of new technologies and an ever-growing population, the future of creative art is uncertain. Some experts predict that creativity will become more subdued and that it will be replaced by more factual or technological-based art. Others predict that creativity will continue to thrive and that it will be used in more creative ways. There are many potential reasons why this may happen, but one thing is for sure: the future of creative art is still largely unknown.

The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artist’s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.
