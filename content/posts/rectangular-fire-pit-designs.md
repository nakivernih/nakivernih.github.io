What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.

What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:

Improving Yourcrawlspace: How can you make your home more comfortable and inviting with a few easy steps?
Are you tired of your home feeling like it's always hot and stuffy? Do you feel like your crawlspace is a hostile place where things can't get out? If so, then you may want to consider some easy steps to improve your space. Here are a few tips that can help:
1. Make sure there is enough ventilation in your crawlspace. This simple task can reduce the amount of heat that builds up inside, and it can also make your home more inviting and comfortable.

2. Add insulation to your walls and ceilings. This will help keep the heat out while providing good insulation for the rest of your home.

3. Use natural lightening devices within your space to increase the amount of natural light that comes in. This will help keep things cooler and brighter inside, which will be great for looking at pictures or working on project documents!
