The history of creative art
Creative art has been around since the dawn of time. cave paintings and sculptures are some of the earliest examples of creative art. Throughout history, creative art has been used as a form of expression. It wasn’t until the Renaissance that artists began to sign their work.
During the Renaissance, creativity was seen as a God-given talent. This period was marked by great advances in art, literature, and music. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were able to express their ideas and emotions through their artwork. The Renaissance was a time of great change and creativity.

In the 20th century, creative art took on many different forms. Abstract expressionism, pop art, and minimalism were all new movements that challenged traditional ideas about art. Today, there are no rules when it comes to creating art.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
