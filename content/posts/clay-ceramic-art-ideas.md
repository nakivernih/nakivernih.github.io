How innovation effects businesses: It can lead to new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful.
Innovation has been a key driver of business success for centuries. For most businesses, innovation is about creating new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful. However, innovation can also lead to changes in how a company does its work that can have significant impacts on its competitive position and overall performance.
For example, imagine you are a business that sells products made from natural materials. As the world becomes increasingly polluted and health hazards increase, your products may not be enough to meet the needs of your customers. To stay competitive, you may need to find new ways to produce and sell your products using more sustainable materials.
