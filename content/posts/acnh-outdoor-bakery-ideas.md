Definition of creativity in the business world: How do creativity and business connect?
Creativity and business are intertwined in a lot of ways. Sometimes it's difficult to define what creativity actually is, but there is definitely a connection between the two. 
In the business world, creativity is often used as a synonym for innovation. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or concepts that might not have been thought of before. In order to be successful, businesses need to be innovative in their approach to their product and services. For example, Apple has always been known for their innovative design and products. They are constantly inspired by new technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. This allowed them to continue expanding their empire even after they were first introduced to the world. 

On the other hand, creativity also goes beyond just doing things differently or having novel ideas.

Invention 3: a way to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers
According to scientists, there are three ways to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers. The first way is to use a fermentation process that breaks down the cellulose in plants into glucose and carbon dioxide. The second way is to use a vacuum sealer that sucks clean air out of the fridge and stores food in airtight containers. The third way is to use an oven as a warming oven that cooks food until it becomes safe to eat. all three methods have their own pros and cons.
