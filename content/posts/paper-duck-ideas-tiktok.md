The Benefits of Creative Ideas: After hearing all of the benefits of creative ideas, it is clear why they are so important in business.
Creative ideas are important in business because they can help businesses create new and innovative products or services. Some of the benefits of creative ideas include: 
1. Increased Productivity – When a business has a good idea, they can often improve their productivity as they can better focus on what they are supposed to be doing. 
2. Improved Delight at Work – While some businesses may find it difficult to come up with creative ideas, creative thinking often leads to increased delight and satisfaction with work. This is due in part to the fact that creativity opens up new possibilities and helps businesses explore the potential of their products or services in a more interesting way than if they were just following pre-determined paths.

Creative processes: How do you go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in any form, whether it’s coming up with a new product, idea for a new show, or even just a new way to look at something. Whether you want to come up with something original or simply reuse an existing idea, there are some key processes that you need to follow when coming up with creative ideas. 
The first step is to think about what you want your product or show to be. Once you have this idea in mind, it’s important to brainstorm different ways that you can make it happen.
