How can innovation be used to improve businesses?
Innovation is a key element of business success. It can be used to improve businesses by providing new and unique solutions to problems, or by creating new ways to do business. There are several ways that innovation can be used in business, but some of the most common are: 
1. Innovation can help businesses increase sales and profits. When businesses use innovation to create new products or services that are more successful than those available before, they can make more money and achieve their goals more quickly.
2. Innovation can help businesses reduce costs. When businesses use innovation to come up with new ways to produce goods or services, they can save money on both production and marketing costs. This is especially important for small businesses, which may not have the resources or budget to spend on large-scale innovations. 
3. Innovation can help businesses improve customer service.

Definition of big ideas: What is it, and why should we care?
The definition of big ideas can vary greatly, but typically they refer to ideas that could have a significant impact on society or the world.

Here are five definitions of big ideas that may help make them more clear:
1) A big idea is an innovative solution or plan that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
2) A big idea is a new way of thinking about something that's been around for a while but hasn't been fully explored.
3) An idea with potential to create jobs, boost economy, or improve education is often called a big idea.

In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before.
