Conclusion: What is invention? How important is it? Why has it been so important in human history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to write and ideas have been able to spread. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or solution, which can be used to improve something that someone else has created. Inventions have helped people achieve success in a variety of fields, from technology to medicine. In recent years, however, invention has come under fire from some who argue that it is an important part of plagiarism and creativity. Though there are some merits to Invention, it is important to understand its importance before making any decisions about its use in human history.

Conclusion: What are some tips for coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new concept for a business to coming up with a new design for a shirt. There are many creative ideas out there, but it can be hard to come up with the right one. Here are some tips to help you come up with the best ideas: 
1) Take some time to think about what you want your idea to say. What is your message? Are you trying to create something new or improve an existing product? If so, think about how you could make your idea more unique and interesting. 
2) Consider what others might want or need. Not all ideas should be based on what people might want or need. Sometimes, you can come up with an idea that is completely unrelated and still be effective. 
3) Be patient and don‚Äôt expect everything to happen at once.

The Impacts of Invention: How does innovation impact society as a whole?
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries, but the impact of innovation has only grown in recent decades. Innovation has the ability to change the way we live and work, as well as the ways we view the world around us. The benefits of innovation are vast, and it has had a positive impact on economies, society, and environment. However, there are some challenges that need to be considered before continuing to see such positive impacts. One key challenge is that innovation can often lead to new technologies that can be dangerous or harmful if not used responsibly. Another challenge is that innovation often depends on someone else‚Äôs idea or idea being implemented first, which can lead to competition andefficiency in some industries. Overall, these challenges underscore the importance of ensuring that all who benefit from innovation are taken care of when it comes time for new products or services to be created.
