The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

Some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique:
When it comes to problem solving, one of the most important techniques is brainstroming. Brainstroming is a process of using your thoughts and ideas to brainstorm solutions to problems. It’s a great way to come up with potential solutions and get started on solving a problem. However, there are some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique. Here are five examples:
1) You don’t have enough time: Brainstroming is supposed to be a process that takes around 20 minutes. If you’re trying to solve a problem that’s taking longer than that, you may not have enough time left to come up with solutions.

2) You don’t know what you’re looking for: WhenBrainstroming, you need to be specific about what you want to come up with.
