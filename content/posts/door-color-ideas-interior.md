Conclusion
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. However, it has only recently become a buzzword in the business world.
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is about creating something new or improving upon something that already exists. Innovation can be big or small. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a cup of coffee or as complex as developing a new form of renewable energy.

There are four main types of innovation: product, process, business model, and social. Product innovation is about creating new products or improving upon existing ones. Process innovation is about improving the way things are done. Business model innovation is about changing the way businesses operate. Social innovation is about solving social problems in new and innovative ways.

The impact of creativity on society: What are the benefits of creativity?
Creativity is often seen as a good thing, as it can help us come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. However, some people contend that creativity can actually have negative effects on society. It can lead to less innovation, creativity being used more for the purposes of entertainment instead of real-world solutions, and even social unrest. But how do we determine whether or not creativity has positive or negative effects on society? And should we be striving for more creative output?
