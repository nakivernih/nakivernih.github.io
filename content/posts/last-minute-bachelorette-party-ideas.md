How creativity manifests in different people: Inventors are the most creative, while artists are more creative when they have a personal connection to their work
Creativity is not only evident in inventors, but also in artists. When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it. This has been shown by many studies that show creativity flourishes when people have close relationships with others. For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. 
However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.

The definition of creativity: What is creativity?
Creativity is an important word. It has been used to describe many different things in the past, but its meaning has changed over time. In ancient Greece, creativity was defined as making something new. This idea wasn't widely accepted by people at that time, but it is still used today. In the modern world, creativity is often used to describe how something can be done or how something can be created. However, there is no one definition of creativity. There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.
