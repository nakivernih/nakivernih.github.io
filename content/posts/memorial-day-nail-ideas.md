Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!
