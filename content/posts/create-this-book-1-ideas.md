How do you come up with big ideas?
Many people come up with big ideas on their own. However, it can be difficult to come up with ideas that are both original and exciting. There are a few things that you can do to help increase your chances of coming up with big ideas. One is to think about what other people have done or are doing that you would like to emulate. Another is to develop a plan or idea for something and then go ahead and create a prototype of it. Finally, you can try thinking outside the box andcome up with new ways to do something that hasn't been done before.
