The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.

Big Data: How big data is changing the way businesses operate and what implications this has for everything from marketing to customer service.
Big data is now a big part of business operations. How this affects everything from marketing to customer service is a topic of debate. Some businesses see big data as a way to increase efficiency and make decisions faster, while others are concerned that it could have negative consequences. Here are four examples of how big data is changing the business landscape:
1) They're using big data to assess customer needs and then cater to them with tailored marketing campaigns. Previously, businesses conducted marketing research through questionnaire surveys or focus groups. With big data, businesses can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze huge amounts of information about customers in order to better understand their needs and preferences. This allows companies to identify what products or services are most popular and need improvement, which in turn can lead to new product development or even new sales campaigns.
