Conclusion: How does creativity work and how can we use it to our advantage?
Creativity is an important part of any business. By using creativity, businesses can come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can help businesses reach new heights in their industry or achieve specific goals. Here are a few tips on how to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Ideas are not came from a vacuum; they come from what you have in your periphery. When you start taking things apart and looking at them from other angles, you will get more creative ideas. This is especially true when it comes to brainstorming – by breaking things down into smaller pieces, you are more likely to come up with multiple different solutions that may be better for the company. 

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks; if something feels unorthodox or risky, it is likely because it is.
