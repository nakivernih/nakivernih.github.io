What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are always a good thing, especially when they can help improve someone's day-to-day life. Here are some of the best ideas around: 
1. Make a list of what you need in order to start painting or sculpting. This will give you a starting point for creating something that you're passionate about and can work on for hours. 
2. Draw inspiration from other cultures and their art styles. This can help you to create pieces that are unique and interesting. 
3. Take a walk outside and take in the atmosphere. This can provide you with many different ideas for art projects that you may not have considered before. 
4. Use technology to your advantage! If you have an Instagram or Facebook account, start postulating creative ways to use it in your artwork instead of just letting it be an eyesore.
