The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether it’s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.

1. Start with a blank slate: Start by thinking about what you want your new project to be. What are some ideas for concepts or ideas you’d like to explore? Once you have a few ideas, start brainstorming them and see what comes up. 
2. Take your time: Don’t try to do everything at once. Instead, work on one part of the project at a time and then move on to the next. This will help you get started and avoid having too much work put on your plate at once. 
3. Be organized: Make sure that when you’re starting a project, you have an idea of what you need and how it will be organized. This way, when you get stuck, you know where to look for help.
