Idea 3: We need to be more open about our values
The world is constantly changing, and so too are the ways that people value and hold onto certain values. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be more open about our own values.
One way to do this is by sharing our thoughts with others. Another way is by writing down what we believe and why it matters to us. Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with someone who understands our values in order for us to start writing them down ourselves.

Ultimately, we need to be more conscious about how we value the things that matter most to us in order to stay ahead of the curve and stay true to our own values.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is a key word when it comes to artists. It can mean different things to different people, but in general, creativity refers to the ability of an individual to come up with new and innovative ideas. This doesn’t just mean coming up with new ways to look at an old problem or coming up with new solutions to old problems; creativity can also be used to come up with new ways of looking at things. For example, if you were a painter and you wanted to create a painting that depicted the history of art, you might come up with something that showed how various Artists have used their creativity in order to create their work. In fact, some artists even go so far as to say that creativity is the only thing that separates them from other professional artists.
