Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
