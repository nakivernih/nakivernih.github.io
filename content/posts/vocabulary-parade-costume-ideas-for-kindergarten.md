Creative process is how do you go about creating something new? There are many ways to approach creative endeavors, but one of the most common and effective ways is to start with a blank slate. This allows you to focus on your idea and not worry about what others might think or say. It can also be helpful to have a specific goal in mind before starting the creative process. Once you have your idea down, it’s time to start writing! The best way to come up with good ideas is by brainstorming with other people. This will help you come up with new concepts and ideas that could work on paper. Once you have some good ideas, it’s time to start working on them!
