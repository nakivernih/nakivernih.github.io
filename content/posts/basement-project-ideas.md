Conclusion: Are there any drawbacks to having ideas? How can you overcome them?
Ideas are a great way to think about new ideas and come up with new ways to do things. However, there are some drawbacks that can occur when having ideas. The first drawback is that it can be difficult to come up with all of the details needed for an idea to take off. This can lead to a lack of confidence in your idea and a less likely chance of seeing it through to the end. Another drawback is that ideas can be very time-consuming and require a lot of effort from you and others involved in the project. This can lead to feeling overworked or undervalued when it comes time for the idea to actually be implemented.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
