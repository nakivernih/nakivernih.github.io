What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas: 
1. Start with one. This may seem like a ridiculously simple suggestion, but if you don’t have any big ideas to start with, you won’t be able to come up with anything great. After all, success isn’t about having a lot of small accomplishments; it’s about achieving great things starting small. 
2. Take things one step at a time.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.

Marketability of inventions: How can you make your inventions stand out from the competition?
Invention ideas can be everything from a new product to a better way to do something. But in order to make your inventions stand out and be more marketable, it's important to have good ideas that are easy to understand and understand why people would want them. Here are five tips on how to make your inventions stand out:
