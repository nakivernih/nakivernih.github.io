What is invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product. It can be anything from developing a new toy to creating a new recipe. Inventors are often very creative and come up with great ideas when they have nothing else to go on. There are many different types of inventions, but the three that come to mind are: products, services, and ideas.

How will you make sure that your content is useful and engaging?
The content of an article should be useful, engaging and interesting to the reader. It should also be clear, concise and easy to read. Here are 8 tips for making sure that your content is useful, engaging and interesting:
1. Take into account the audience you are addressing. What are the interests of your audience? Are they business owners, consumers or both? When writing for a specific audience, make sure to consider what information will be most effective for them.

2. Use clear language and images to help explain your ideas. People understand words more when they can see them clearly. Try using images throughout your article so that readers can visualize the concepts being discussed.

3. Use originality and creativity when creating new ideas. Don’t plagiarize other people’s work – it won’t make your content any better or more engaging.
