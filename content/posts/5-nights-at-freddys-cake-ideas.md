History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something. This includes both the simple things like making tools or buildings, and more complex items like air travel or computers. Inventions have had a direct impact on the way we live and work, as well as the way society functions.
