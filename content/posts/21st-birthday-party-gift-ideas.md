Definition of creativity: How is it different from other forms of art?
Creativity is defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, or new ways of seeing things. It can be different in every situation, and it often depends on the person. Some people might call creativity "the power of the heart." Others might say that creativity comes from a feeling or attitude. It's important to remember that creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas, but also having the courage to experiment and try out different ways of thinking.
