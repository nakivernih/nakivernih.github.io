Overcoming barriers to innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to maintain a competitive edge, but it can be difficult to encourage employees to think outside the box. Overcoming these barriers is key to promoting a culture of innovation in your organization.
One barrier to innovation is risk aversion. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas for fear of being seen as failures if they don't work out. Encouraging a culture of experimentation can help overcome this hurdle by making it okay to try new things and fail.

Another common barrier is lack of resources. Employees may feel like they don't have the time or money to experiment with new ideas. Providing dedicated resources for innovation can help overcome this obstacle and show employees that you're serious about encouraging creativity.

Finally, some employees may simply be resistant to change. They may be comfortable with the way things are and see no need to innovate.

Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.
