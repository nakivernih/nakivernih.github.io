What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make things better. From new ways to solve problems to coming up with unique ways of selling products, there are endless creative possibilities out there. Here are a few examples that might be of interest to you: 
1. A new way to use old materials – This is something that can often be creative and innovative. For example, some people create sculptures from old tires or cardboard. This not only uses the materials well but also creates an interesting final product. 
2. Using technology in a new way – Another great way to come up with creative ideas is to use technology in a different way than it usually is used. For example, some people create illuminated signs using lightbulbs implanted in the skin.

What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural. Scientific innovation occurs when scientists come up with new ways to study the world around them and improve our understanding of it. Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.
