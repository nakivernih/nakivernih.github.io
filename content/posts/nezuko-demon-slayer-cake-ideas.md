How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, itâ€™s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what youâ€™re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If itâ€™s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it wonâ€™t be successful.

Idea 1: Share your life story
If you've been married for 10 years, or longer, you know that sharing your life story is a tradition. It's a way to show people that you're committed to them and appreciate them. But what if sharing your life story doesn't feel like it's important to you? What if it feels like a chore?
That's where ideas come in. In order to feel more fulfilled in our lives, we need to focus on what truly matters. So why not share your life story with someone who mattersthrough those experiences? Why not tell them everything about your marital status, your job history, and all of the little things that make up your day-to-day?

It'll give them a currency of understanding and appreciation. Plus, they might be inspired by how much you appreciate them themselves... which is always an added bonus!
