Lessons learned from innovation: What have been some of the most successful implementations?
Innovation is a process of making something better. In technology, innovation often refers to the birth of new products or technologies, or the alteration of a design to make it more efficient, effective, or user-friendly. Innovation has been successful in many industries and sectors over the years, but there are some lessons that can be learned from some of the most successful implementations.
One such example is Google's Gmail, which was first introduced in 2000 and became wildly popular. The service allowed users to easily communicate with one another without having to leave their computers. It also became one of the first online services to offer free email storage for users. In addition, Gmail was originally designed as a way for small businesses to connect with larger companies and share files easier than ever before.

Origin of Invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that was not originally planned or conceived by someone else. It can be anything from building a new computer to creating a new type of sauce. Inventions have been around for centuries, but their origins are still unknown. One possible explanation for the birth of invention is that somebody came up with the idea in their head and then put it into practice. Another theory suggests that somebody else helped develop the original idea before it was put into action. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question – each person’s experience and knowledge will likely differ on how they came up with the original product or idea.
