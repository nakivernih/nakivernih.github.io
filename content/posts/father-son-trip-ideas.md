Creative ideas: How to come up with them?
Creative ideas are something that everyone has. Whether you’re a creative writer, artist, or just about anything else, creativity is always on the horizon. Here are 8 tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Start with an idea and work from there. If you have an idea for a book, start by writing the first chapter and seeing what kind of feedback you get from readers. Once you have a feel for what works and doesn’t work in your book, then come up with some tweaks.

2. Get inspired by others. There are endless sources of inspiration when it comes to creative ideas! Look at paintings, sculptures, movies, TV shows – anything that inspires you in some way!

3. Take risks. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, sometimes all it takes is a risk!

The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.
