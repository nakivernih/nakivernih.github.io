The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.
