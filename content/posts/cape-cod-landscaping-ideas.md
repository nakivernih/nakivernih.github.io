Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.
