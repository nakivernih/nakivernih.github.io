Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development. In today's economy, creativity is becoming more and more important as businesses strive to stay competitive.
One way that creativity can help businesses is by providingid→products or services that are not possible with traditional methods.

Once the product is developed, it could be marketed using creative ideas like creating slogans or marketing videos that are unique and engaging.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.
