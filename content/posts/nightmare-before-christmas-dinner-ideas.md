How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.

Offering a new product or service
A new product or service can be a big idea. It can be something that is different and exciting, or it can be something that is helpful and necessary. Whether it is a new way to cook your food, or a new way to keep your home clean, there are many options when it comes to creating a new product or service. 
One of the best things about offering a new product or service is that people are always curious. They want to see what it is and how it works. This curiosity can lead to increased sales for your company, as people want to know more about what you have to offer.
