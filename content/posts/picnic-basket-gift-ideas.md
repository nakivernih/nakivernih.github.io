Conclusion: Ideas are the lifeblood of progress
Ideas are the lifeblood of progress. Without them, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, day in and day out. Ideas help us to see things in new ways, to find new solutions to old problems, and to keep moving forward.
There are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with ideas:

1. Be open-minded. Be willing to consider all possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first.

2. Take inspiration from others. Look at what others have done and see how you can build on their ideas or take them in a new direction.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.

Big ideas are the stuff that can take your work to a whole new level. They're the ones that will challenge you and make you rethink everything you know.
