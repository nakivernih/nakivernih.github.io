Blog design: How should you style your blog?
Creating a well designed blog can be a lot of fun. It gives you the opportunity to show your wares and share your knowledge in a way that is easy to read and follow. There are a few things to keep in mind when designing your blog, though, so that you can create an attractive and informative website for your readers.
1. Make sure your blog is easy to navigate. AllBlogs has an easy-to-use navigation bar that makes it straightforward for you to find what you’re looking for. You don’t need a complicated layout or sidebar if all you want is to take users straight to the post they were interested in.

2. Keep your posts short and easily digestible. When you have long paragraphs crammed into each post, it becomes difficult for readers to stay on top of what you’re saying.

Invention ideas come from all over the world, and some are more common than others. Some of the more common invention ideas include: computer chips, phone cases, airbags, and water filters. No one invention is right for everyone, so it's important to consider what you want your invention to do and who your target market is.
