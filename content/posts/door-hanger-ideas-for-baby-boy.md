In 2022, many believe that the United States should consider a new immigration policy that prioritized people who can contribute to society. Ideas for this policy could include increasing the number of refugees who are allowed into the country, increasing the number of visas available for skilled immigrants, and lowering the waiting times for citizenship. Another idea is to have a more open exchange market between the US and other countries, which would create jobs and increase wages.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
