Ideas for health care: What can we do to improve access to health care?
There are many ways to improve access to health care, but some of the most common solutions include creating more affordable and accessible clinics and hospitals, expanding Medicaid, and improving the quality of care available through the Veterans Affairs system. There are also many ideas for reform that can be proposed in order to improve the overall experience for patients who use health care services. For example, a program that provides free preventive services could help reduce the number of doctor visits and hospitalizations related to health problems. Another idea is to tryouts for new medical treatments in order to find which ones work best on a individual basis.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
