Editing andpublishing: What steps do you take after coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be a daunting task, but it's important to first take steps to editing and publishing your ideas. Once you've created some great concepts, it's important to make sure that they're properly accessible and saleable. Here are some key steps to follow:
1. Establish your tone and voice. Once you've come up with a good concept, it's important to establish a tone in order to sell it. You don't want your idea to come off as cheesy or written by someone who is just trying to cash in. Be sure that your idea has an interesting plot, strong visuals, and interesting dialogue.

2. Research your marketability. Once you have a solid tone and voice, it's time to research the marketability of your ideas. Do you have an existing audience? Are your concepts easy to understand?

Basics: What are the different creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and forms, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether you’re looking to create an idea for your next project or just start thinking about new ways to improve your skills, there are some basic tips to get you started. Here are four quick ideas for getting started:
1. Take a walk around your city and think about what might be possible with different transportation options. What would a more efficient commute look like? What if the bridges and tunnels were repurposed as public art spaces? These are just a few examples of how creativity can be used in everyday life.

2. Make something using materials that you already have on hand. This could mean recycling materials such as old cans or cups, or finding new sources of inspiration from nature.
