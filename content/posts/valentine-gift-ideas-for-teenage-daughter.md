What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there.
