Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from other types of change?
Innovation is a new way of doing things, or a change in the way things are done. Innovation can apply to any type of business, but it's most common in the technology and business sectors.
Different types of innovation can have different effects on businesses. For example, change in product design can lead to increased sales; change in distribution methods can lead to new customer base; and change in customer service systems can create new opportunities for growth.

There are a number of factors that go into defining innovation, including the specific industry or sector where it's being applied, the goals for the innovation, and how well it's executed. There are also five main characteristics that define innovation: risk-taking, creative thinking, rapid response time, team collaboration, and systemic impact.

How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.
