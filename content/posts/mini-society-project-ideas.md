Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.

Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.
