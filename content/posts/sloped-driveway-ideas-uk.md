Ideas for New Products: What new products are being created that could be appealing to people?
New products are being created all the time that could be appealing to people, such as new transportation options, wellness advancements, and more.

A bike-sharing service that would allow people to use bikes to get around town instead of having to take public transportation. This could be especially helpful for those who live in complexes or have difficult access to public transportation. 2. A weight loss supplement that was made specifically for women and would help them lose weight and reduce their risk of heart disease. 3. An aromatherapy inhaler that could be used for general health benefits or for aromatherapy applications such as treating stress and anxiety.
