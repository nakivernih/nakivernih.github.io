Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.

The future of innovation
The future of innovation is exciting, but it also has a lot of potential drawbacks. Many experts believe that innovation can be used to create new products and services that are more efficient, more affordable, or even more dangerous. However, these benefits often come with a cost – the creativity and ingenuity of the innovator is often required to come up with new ideas that can save people time, money, or even lives. If this process is not done right, the innovation could instead lead to danger and disaster.
