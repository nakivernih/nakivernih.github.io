How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs. This will help you determine which problems might be best solved by creating a new product or service, or by improving an existing one.

2. Consider who your target market is.
