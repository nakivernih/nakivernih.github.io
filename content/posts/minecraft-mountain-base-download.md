what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.

Defining creativity:
In order to better understand creativity, it is important to first define it. Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. This could involve thinking outside of the box, being imaginative, and having a unique perspective.
Some people are more creative than others, but everyone has the ability to be creative in some way. There are many different ways to express creativity, such as through art, writing, music, and even problem-solving.

Creativity is often thought of as a rare talent, but with a little practice, anyone can improve their creativity. The next time you’re feeling stuck or uninspired, try brainstorming with a friend or taking on a new challenge. You may be surprised at the results!
