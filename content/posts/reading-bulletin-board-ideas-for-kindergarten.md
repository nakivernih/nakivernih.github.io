10 Ideas for a Clean and Lovely Home
1. Start with a cleanliness perspective. Cleaning up your home can be as simple as taking out the trash and putting away your clothes. Or, you could go all out and make a cleaning frenzy by hiring a professional to come out and clean everything from the ceilings to the toilet bowl. The point is, you can start small and gradually increase the frequency of yourcleanup as you become more comfortable with the idea of having a clean home.
2. Make room for organization. One of the most important aspects of having a clean home is making sure there are enough spaces to store your belongings. Whether it’s an attic or one of your downstairs rooms, make sure that you have enough storage space to accommodate all of your belongings. And, if possible, make use of wall-mounted shelves or racks for added organization.

3. Get organized yourself!

Ideas: How can we use new ideas toOur lives?
There are so many new ideas out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
-Start with a problem. What do you need more of? More money? More love? Something in between? When you start thinking about things this way, you'll be more likely to come up with ideas for addressing your needs in new and innovative ways. 
-Think outside the box. What if there was a way to use something that's usually used for something else? For example, think about using recycled materials in architecture. You could create unique, sustainable structures with ease! 
-Consider your own needs first. What do you need more of in life than money or love? After all, those two things are obviously necessary for most people. But what do you really need in order to feel fulfilled and happy?
