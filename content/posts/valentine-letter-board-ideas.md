Creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life
Creativity is a key part of life and can be used to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and achieve goals. Here are some creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life:
1. Get inspired by nature: Look at pictures of natural disasters or scenes from around the world and think of creative ways you could incorporate them into your home or workspace. This can be a great way to bond with nature and get lost in the moment.
2. Try something new: When you have a blank canvas, try painting or sculpting without any preconceptions about what you will end up with. Just go for it! This can help you start thinking outside the box and come up with new ideas that might not have been considered before.
3. Get organized: When it comes to creativity, order is key.

Creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas are something that come to people without warning. They can be something as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or a new way to do something you’ve always done but didn’t think of before. The important thing is that the idea has to be something that you can see yourself doing in the future, and that you can imagine living your life with. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 
1. Don’t force yourself to come up with ideas; let your mind wander. There are no right or wrong answers, just some helpful things to keep in mind when brainstorming: What do you want? What does this have potential to achieve? What would make this an interesting and useful addition to your product or service? How can you make it more efficiently or effectively?
