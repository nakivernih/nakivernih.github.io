2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.
