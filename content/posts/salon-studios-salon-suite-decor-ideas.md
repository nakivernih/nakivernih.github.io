What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

The final word: What is the most important thing you can learn from your experiences with developing and implementing big ideas?
Big ideas are a staple in business and life, but they can be difficult to implement. Here are three tips for developing big ideas:
1. Be prepared to fail. The most important thing you can learn from your experiences with big ideas is that it’s not always easy or straightforward to reach your goals. Don’t be discouraged – look for ways to overcome any obstacles and reach your destination.

2. Take the time to analyze your success rates. It can be helpful to track how often you achieve your goals with big ideas compared to other projects you’ve worked on in the past. This will give you a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t when it comes time to put big ideas into practice.

3. Be persistent.
