1. Idea Submission: How do you go about submitting an idea?
When you want to submit an idea to a news outlet, there are a few things you need to do in order to make sure your submission is accepted. 
You first need to create a proposal, which will include information about the idea and why it should be included in the outlet's story. You can also find resources online that can help you with this process, such as The White House's website or the National Broadcasting Corporation's website. 
Next, you need to go through an editing process and make sure your idea is ready for publication. This may involve some changes, but it is important that your submission meets all requirements before it is sent for review. 
Once your idea has been edited and approved by staff at the outlet, you will then need to promote and sell your submission to potential customers.

Ideas for the future of technology are constantly being created, but it is difficult to come up with a definite plan. One thing that seems to be on the horizon is the potential for artificial intelligence to take over many tasks that humans would currently use. This could have a large impact on society, as well as the economy. Another trend that has been growing in recent years is the usage of 3D printing technology. This allows users to create objects without having to use a traditional manufacturing process.

Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.
