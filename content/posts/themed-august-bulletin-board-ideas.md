How to come up with ideas
If you're like most people, the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ideas is creativity. However, if you're like most people, coming up with ideas can be a challenge. 
Here are some tips to help come up with great ideas: 
1. Have a clear goal in mind 
Before you can start thinking about ways to achieve your goal, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. This will help you focus on the right things and make sure that your brainstorming process is efficient. 
2. Be organized 
 disorderly thinking will soon lead to ineffective brainstorming sessions. Make sure that your brainstorming tools are properly organized so that every step is accounted for (e.g., paper, pen, list). This will streamline the process and help you produce more effective ideas.

Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Googleâ€™s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.
