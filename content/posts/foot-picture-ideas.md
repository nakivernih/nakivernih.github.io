1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.

How can we bring these ideas to life?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They give a direction, a potential solution, and a reason to keep going. By coming up with big ideas, you can inspire your team and yourself to continue trying new things even when things feel threatening or difficult. Here are eight ways to bring big ideas to life:
1. Come up with an idea that’s outside the box: There’s no shame in being original, but many startups focus on what others are doing instead of coming up with their own concepts or solutions. If you don’t have anything similar in mind, you can always consider using popular trends or phrases as your starting point.

2. Take on a challenge: When it comes time to come up with a concept or solution, sometimes challenges are what help foster creativity and innovation.
