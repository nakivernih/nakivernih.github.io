Overcoming creative blocks.
Creativity is a trait that is often associated with artists, musicians, and other professionals in the arts. However, creativity is not just a talent that only these people possess. Everyone has the ability to be creative, but sometimes we can get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to be creative. If you're feeling uninspired, here are a few tips to help you overcome your creative block.
1. Take a break from your project. Sometimes the best way to get out of a funk is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Step away from your work and clear your mind.

2. Talk to other people about your project.
