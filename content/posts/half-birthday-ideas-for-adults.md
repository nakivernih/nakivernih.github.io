What is invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with an original solution to a problem. In many cases, innovation happens when people come up with new ways to do something that had been done before. Sometimes, invention can be something as simple as creating a new type of fuel or product. There are many different types of inventions, but the key word to remember is that they all have the potential to make life easier or more effective.

The definition of creative art and how it has no limits
Creative art has no definitive answer or meaning. It is art that is created from the imagination, emotions, and thoughts of an artist. It can be anything that the artist wants it to be, and there are no limits on what can be considered creative art.
Some people may say that creative art is only valid if it is created with a certain purpose or meaning in mind, but that is not the case. The beauty of creative art is that it can be whatever the artist wants it to be, and there are no rules or boundaries that need to be followed.

The sky's the limit when it comes to creative art, and that's what makes it so special. Anyone can create something beautiful and unique, regardless of their skill level or experience.
