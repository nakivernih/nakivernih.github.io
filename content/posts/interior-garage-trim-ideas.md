What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? It’s a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. They can’t explain it, but they know it exists. Brainstroming is when a person’s thoughts and ideas are constantly going through their head, like the thoughts of a machine. The problem is, nobody knows why this happens or how to stop it. Some people say that brainstroming is caused by mental exhaustion or stress, while others say it’s the result of some sort of mental enhancement. There isn’t one answer to this question, and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes brainstroming and how to stop it.
