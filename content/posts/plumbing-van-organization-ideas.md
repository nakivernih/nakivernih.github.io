Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.

Definition of innovation: How can it be used in business?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service or idea that is different from the existing ones. Innovation can be used in business in different ways and can be seen as a way to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue and create new opportunities for businesses. There are many different types of innovation, but three main types are product innovation, service innovation and market niche innovation. Product Innovation: Product innovation occurs when a company creates a new product that better meets the needs of their customers. This can involve developing a new type of product, designing an innovative marketing strategy or even coming up with a unique idea for a product.
