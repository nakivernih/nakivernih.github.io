Benefits of innovation:
Innovation has many benefits for businesses, including resulting in new products and services, improved efficiency, and increased profits. It can also create new markets, attract new customers, and increase the bottom line. Innovation is key to any company's success, so it's important to consider all of its potential benefits when making decisions about how to apply it. Here are a few examples:
1. New products or services: A product that is innovative can be more successful than one that is not because it is new and different, but because it is well-designed and uses high-quality materials.

2. Improved efficiency: When a business adopts an innovative approach to manufacturing or marketing its products, it can save time and money. This can lead to increased profits for the business.

For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium.
