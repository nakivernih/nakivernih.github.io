The brainstroming phenomenon is when people's thoughts track the same topic for a sustained period of time. In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks. In other cases, it may be more sporadic - for example, if someone thinks about the same topic once and then doesn't think about it for a week or two.

What are some easy and effective ways to improve your home’s energy efficiency?
There are many easy and effective ways to improve your home's energy efficiency, but it depends on your needs and what you're targeting. Here are a few tips:
1. Improve insulation - An improved insulation will help reduce your home's energy bill by reducing the amount of heat that comes in and out. Start by making sure all of your walls and ceilings are installed with at least 1/2 inch of R-Value. This will help avoid excess heat from coming in, as well as save money on your heating bill in the long run.

2. Add window air conditioners - If you havewindows that open into small spaces or if the windows don't have fans, adding window air conditioners can save you a lot of money in the long run.

Conclusion: How can we address the big ideas and challenges in our society?
In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in big ideas and challenges in our society. This trend began to take root in the 1970s with the work of Murray Bookchin, and has continued to grow in recent years as more people have become interested in concepts such as human emancipation, sustainability, and democracy.
There are a number of big ideas that need to be addressed if we want to see a flourishing society that is both sustainable and emancipatory. Here are three examples:

1) We need a new understanding of what it means to be human. We currently operate within a systems-based view of being human, which values materialism over spiritual development. This perspective creates obstacles for humans as they try to find their place within the world.

2) We need a new understanding of how social movements can work together.
