The benefits of big ideas: How do they benefit society as a whole?
Big Ideas offer a way to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can improve society as a whole. There are many benefits to big ideas, both private and public. Here are three of the most common: 
1) They inspire people to think about how they can improve their community and themselves. Big Ideas encourage people to question why things are the way they are and look for ways to make their world a better place. This can lead to change, both in the individual and community levels.

2) They help us confront problems we might not have seen before. Big Ideas give us new perspectives on how to solve problems and bring about change. This can be exciting because it allows us to see solutions that we might not have considered before.

3) They help us connect with others who share our same goals or values.
