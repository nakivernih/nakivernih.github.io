The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

The history of invention: Discuss the origins of invention and how it has changed over time.
Invention is the process of bringing ideas or objects together in a new way. It is often seen as the first step in creating something new, and it has been an important part of human history since the beginning.
The first inventions were probably simple tools and devices that made everyday tasks easier. Over time, more complex inventions were developed, such as the wheel and the printing press. In the Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid change in technology and manufacturing, many new inventions were created, such as the steam engine and the cotton gin.

Today, invention is still an important part of society. New technologies are constantly being developed, and many companies invest heavily in research and development to create new products. Invention is also becoming more democratized thanks to tools like 3D printers and open-source hardware platforms that make it easier for people to create their own products.
