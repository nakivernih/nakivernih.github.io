What is creativity?
Creativity is an innate quality that all humans possess. What differentiates creatives from non-creatives, however, is their capacity to imagine new possibilities and come up with new ideas. In other words, creativity is the ability to see things in a different light and come up with new ways to do things. This quality can be developed through creative endeavors such as art, music, writing, architecture and more.
