Conclusion: Are there any drawbacks to having ideas? How can you overcome them?
Ideas are a great way to think about new ideas and come up with new ways to do things. However, there are some drawbacks that can occur when having ideas.

This can lead to a lack of confidence in your idea and a less likely chance of seeing it through to the end. Another drawback is that ideas can be very time-consuming and require a lot of effort from you and others involved in the project.
