Conclusion: the importance of creative art in our lives
It is safe to say that creative art is important in our lives. After all, it is one of the few things that can truly make us feel alive. It can inspire us, move us, and even change us.
Think about the last time you were moved by a piece of art. Maybe it was a painting, a song, or even a film. Whatever it was, it likely had a profound effect on you. That’s because creative art has the power to touch our souls in a way that nothing else can.

For many people, art is a way to deal with difficult emotions and experiences. It can be a way to process trauma, express anger, and even find forgiveness.

Scientific brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. It usually happens when an individual is working on a project and they have no other ideas.
