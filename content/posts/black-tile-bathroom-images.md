How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.

Differences between creative visual and auditory artists: Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read books. Kinesthetic artists may use their body to create works of art. Gustatory artists may choose flavors or smells to add
Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read book. While the two mediums have certain similarities, there are also significant differences that can make a difference in the way an artist creates their work. For example, visual artists often use colors and shapes to create patterns and images while auditory artists often listen to music or read books as sources of inspiration. Additionally, visual artists may use more abstract techniques while auditory artists may prefer more realistic portrayals of their subjects. While these differences may seem minor, they can make a huge impact in the way an artist completes their work.

Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).
