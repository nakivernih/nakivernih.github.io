The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

What are some of the benefits of starting a blog?
There are many benefits to starting a blog, whether you’re just starting out or have been blogging for years. Here are a few examples: 
You can build your own audience and brand. 
Publishing regularly allows you to develop an audience and see what others are saying about your content. This can help you determine what topics to write about next, and how to appeal to a wider audience. 
It can also be great for developing relationships with other bloggers and promoting your work. 
Your blog can be used as an information source for customers or clients. If you keep your blog up-to-date with new trends, you may keep your customers coming back for more information even when they don’t want to buy something from you directly.
