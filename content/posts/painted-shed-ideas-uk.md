Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.
