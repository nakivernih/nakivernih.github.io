The 5 Types of Ideas: What they are, what they can do, when to use them, and how we can get started
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help us solve problems. Here are five types of ideas to get started with:
1. Problem identifies and solves: This type of idea is used when you have a specific problem to solve, and there are no other options available. For example, if you’re lost and need to find your way home, you might use this type of idea to identify the problem and come up with a plan to fix it.

2. Plan creation: This type of idea is used to create a plan that will help you achieve your goals. In many cases, this plan will include steps that you can take immediately or that will require some planning (such as setting a date for your meeting).
