Pre-existing Conditions: What are some potential solutions to this problem?
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people looking for ways to help those who have pre-existing conditions. A variety of solutions have been proposed, with the most popular being increasing access to health insurance and creating new government programs that would help those with pre-existing conditions. However, each solution has its own set of disadvantages and drawbacks. One potential solution to this problem is increasing access to health insurance. This could be done through expanding Medicaid or creating new companies that offer affordable health insurance across all states.

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
