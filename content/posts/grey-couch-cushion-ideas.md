How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

The definition of creativity
What is creativity? Many people have different definitions for creativity. Some say that it is when you come up with new and original ideas, while others define it as the ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a process of problem solving, where you take existing knowledge and use it in new and unique ways. Creativity is often associated with artistry and design, but it can also be found in other areas such as business, science, and technology.

There are many ways to encourage creativity. One way is to provide opportunities for people to work on creative projects together. This can help them to come up with new ideas and solutions by bouncing ideas off of each other.
