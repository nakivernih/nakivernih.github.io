Creative Abilities: What makes people creative?
Creativity is a complex, multi-layered concept that has been studied by researchers for years.

However, what makes someone creative? There are many factors to consider, including genes, environment, and learning experiences.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea that has not been previously imagined. Invention can be anything from a new product to a new way of looking at an old problem. It can also be the result of a collaborative effort between many individuals. Inventors often have to come up with an original solution to a problem or come up with a new way to do something that has never been done before.

Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

The power of creativity: How can creativity help you achieve success?
Creative ideas can help you achieve success in any field. Whether you are a artist, writer, or businessperson, creativity can help you achieve your goals. Here are five ways to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Take on new challenges – When you take on new challenges, you increase your chances of succeeding. For example, if you are a creative writer, try writing stories that are unusual or challenging. You may find that your skills improve as you work on these projects. 

2. Use technology – Technology has the ability to help us reach our goals faster and more efficiently than ever before. For example, if you are an artist, consider using online tools to create paintings or sculptures quickly and easily. This way, you can enjoy the process of creating rather than having to wait for turnaround times for your product or service.

The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.

There are ideas all around us. They are the basis for everything we do, whether we realize it or not. Ideas can be simple, like getting out of bed in the morning, or they can be complex, like developing a new product. Sometimes, we have trouble coming up with ideas, and that's when we need to get creative. There are a few ways to do that: brainstorming, looking at things from a different perspective, and taking a break.
