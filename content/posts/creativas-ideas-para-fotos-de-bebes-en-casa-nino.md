How do you get started with having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get started on anything. Whether you have them all figured out or not, any ideas will help get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips to get started: 
1. Find a place to sit and brainstorm: Whether it’s at home or in a meeting, sitting down and brainstorming ideas will help you come up with new plans and solutions. 
2. Take some time for yourself: Another way to start getting ideas is by taking some time for yourself. This can be done by reading, watching TV, or doing something that you love but which also allows you to think outside the box. 
3. Get organized: Once you have a few good ideas, it’s important to get them organized so that they can be used in future projects.

When it comes to innovation, there are a few things that always seem to set a company apart from the rest. Perhaps the most well-known example is Silicon Valley’s “technology shock,” where innovative new technologies emerged suddenly and explosively in the early 1960s. At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.

Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency. 

But there are other factors as well, such as the need for new ideas or approaches when it comes to solving problems or meeting needs. When these come together, they can result in radical change in an industry or society.
