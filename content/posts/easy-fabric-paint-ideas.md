Invention stories: How some inventions were born and others were created
Invention stories are a common occurrence in history. Many inventions were born from the intersection of two or more different ideas and concepts. One invention might be a new way to do something, while another might be a more efficient way to do something. 
One example of an invention that was created from multiple ideas is the computer. Originally, computers were thought to be simple devices that could only do basic tasks like read and write.

What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.
