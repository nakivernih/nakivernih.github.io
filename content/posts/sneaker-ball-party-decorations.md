Concluding thoughts on big ideas.
In recent years, big ideas have come to the forefront of many people's minds. Some of these innovative concepts are new and exciting, while others are more general in nature but still important in terms of advancing humanity.

Many experts believe that this technology can be used to create intelligent machines that can do a majority of the work for us- from cleaning and grocery shopping to driving and making decisions on things like politics and industry.
