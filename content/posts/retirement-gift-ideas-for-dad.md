The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
