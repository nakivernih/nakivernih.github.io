The benefits of being creative
Creativity is often associated with artistic activities such as painting, drawing, and sculpting. However, being creative goes beyond the arts. Creativity is a way of looking at things differently and coming up with new ideas.
There are many benefits to being creative. One benefit is that it can help you solve problems. When you approach a problem from a creative perspective, you are more likely to come up with an original solution.

Another benefit of being creative is that it can help you communicate better. When you have a new idea, you need to be able to communicate it to others clearly. This can be difficult if you are not used to thinking creatively.

Lastly, being creative can simply make you happier. When you engage in creative activities, your brain releases dopamine, which is a feel-good chemical. This can lead to increased levels of happiness and satisfaction.

What are big ideas? What are some of the most important things to remember when it comes to big ideas?
There are a few important things to remember when it comes to big ideas. The first is that ideas should be focused and specific. If they're not, they'll likely never see the light of day. Second, it's important to have a plan for execution. This will help ensure that your idea actually happens, and doesn't just languish in your head. Finally, you need some backing from others before you can start anything truly big. Without this support, it's more difficult to truly push an idea off the ground.
