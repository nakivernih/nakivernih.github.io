The creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creativity is a process that some people enjoy and others find difficult. The creative process can be broken down into four main categories: 1) Brainstorming 2) Idea generation 3) Implementation 4) Delivery. In order to be creative, one must have an idea and be able to come up with creative ways to express that idea. Additionally, one must have the courage to take risks in order to create something new.

Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
