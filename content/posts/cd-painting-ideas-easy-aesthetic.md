Invention as a Tool for Progress
Invention has always been an important tool for progress. From the invention of the printing press to the development of the internet, invention has helped make societies and economies better. 
However, some inventors have argued that invention is not only a valuable tool, but it can also be used to hinder progress. For example, many people believe that the patent system is too slow and restrictive, which encourages innovation while hindering creativity. Others worry that Invention may eventually become a Replication Service instead of a Tool for Progress.

Regardless of whether or not inventions hinder progress, they remain an important part of human history and culture. In his book "Inventing the Future", John Seelye argues that innovation is essential to our future and that unless we encourage it, we will see stagnation and decline.

Ideas: What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they can also be a bit misguided. Sometimes, an idea is great, but it's not something that will actually work. Other times, an idea is great and something that will actually help people, but it might not be the right thing to do. Ultimately, ideas are important, but they need to be judged on their merits.
