Exercise: How to be creative in your everyday life
Creativity is a key word in everyoneâ€™s vocabulary. Whether you are a creative artist, graphic designer, or just someone who enjoys making things, creativity is important to have in your everyday life. There are so many ways to be creative and put your creativity into use every day- from taking risks with new ideas to using your creativity to solve problems. Here are five tips on how you can become more creative in your everyday life:
