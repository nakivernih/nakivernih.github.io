Innovation ideas can have a wide range of consequences for businesses and individuals.

Other consequences could be more mundane such as how an innovation can impact customer service or how it might change the way products are marketed.

Brainstroming is an acronym for brain storming. Brainstorming is the process of coming up with ideas or solutions to problems. Brainstroming can be done in any setting, but it is most often used in business. By using brainstroming, businesses can come up with new ideas and solutions faster than they would if they were trying to come up with them alone.

What challenges does innovation face?
1. Innovation is faced with a number of challenges, including the challenge of meeting consumer demand while ensuring that products are safe and effective.
2. Innovation can also face challenges from producers and consumers alike, as well as from government agencies that may require new technology to meet specific goals or regulations.

3. There are a number of ways innovation can be tackled, and each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, using traditional methods to develop new products can be more expensive and time-consuming than using novel approaches or ideas to address consumer needs.

What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.
