The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.

What are some easy and effective ways to improve your home’s energy efficiency?
There are many easy and effective ways to improve your home's energy efficiency, but it depends on your needs and what you're targeting. Here are a few tips:
1. Improve insulation - An improved insulation will help reduce your home's energy bill by reducing the amount of heat that comes in and out. Start by making sure all of your walls and ceilings are installed with at least 1/2 inch of R-Value. This will help avoid excess heat from coming in, as well as save money on your heating bill in the long run.

2. Add window air conditioners - If you havewindows that open into small spaces or if the windows don't have fans, adding window air conditioners can save you a lot of money in the long run.
