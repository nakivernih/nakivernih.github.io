The future of technology is constantly in flux, and so is the way we view it.
In the coming years, technology will continue to change and evolve at an alarming rate. Some of the most exciting new ideas that come up in these times are artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain technology, and 3D printing. With these technologies becoming more popular every day, it's important to keep up with the latest trends and developments in order to be ahead of the curve. Here are some examples of how AI is already changing the way we view the world: 
It has long been speculated that AI could soon become self-aware and even sentient. In a recent study published in "Nature", researchers have created a computer program that can learn from itself and develop its own strategy. This is a huge achievement because until now, it has been difficult for computers to learn from their own mistakes.

Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.

Tools and Techniques: How do you know if a project is easy or difficult?
There is no definitive answer when it comes to whether a project is easy or difficult. However, some key factors that can help determine the difficulty level of a project include the resources available, the complexity of the task, and the team's inexperience. Additionally, if a project is assigned to an inexperienced team, then it may be more difficult to complete than if it is assigned to a more experienced team.
